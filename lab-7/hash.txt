CHAPTER
I.
Down
the
Rabbit-Hole
Alice
was
beginning
to
get
very
tired
of
sitting
by
her
sister
on
the
bank,
and
of
having
nothing
to
do:
once
or
twice
she
had
peeped
into
the
book
her
sister
was
reading,
but
it
had
no
pictures
or
conversations
in
it,
‘and
at
is
the
use
of
a
book,’
ught
Alice
‘without
ctures
or
conversations?’
So
she
was
considering
in
her
own
mind
(as
well
as
she
could,
for
the
hot
day
made
her
feel
very
sleepy
and
stupid),
hether
the
pleasure
of
making
a
daisy-chain
would
be
worth
the
trouble
of
getting
up
and
picking
the
daisies,
when
suddenly
a
White
Rabbit
with
pink
eyes
ran
close
by
her.
There
was
nothing
so
VERY
remarkable
in
that;
nor
did
Alice
think
it
so
VERY
much
out
of
the
way
to
hear
the
Rabbit
say
to
itself,
‘Oh
ar!
Oh
dear!
I
shall
be
late!’
en
she
thought
it
over
afterwards,
it
occurred
to
her
that
she
ought
to
have
wondered
at
this,
but
at
the
time
it
all
seemed
quite
natural);
ut
when
the
Rabbit
actually
TOOK
A
WATCH
OUT
OF
ITS
WAISTCOAT-POCKET,
nd
looked
at
it,
and
then
hurried
on,
Alice
started
to
her
feet,
for
it
flashed
across
her
mind
that
she
had
never
before
seen
a
rabbit
with
either
a
waistcoat-pocket,
r
a
watch
to
take
out
of
it,
and
burning
with
curiosity,
she
ran
across
the
field
after
it,
and
fortunately
was
just
in
time
to
see
it
pop
down
a
large
rabbit-hole
under
the
hedge.
In
another
moment
down
went
Alice
after
it,
never
once
considering
how
in
the
world
she
was
to
get
out
again.
The
rabbit-hole
went
straight
on
like
a
tunnel
for
some
way,
and
then
dipped
suddenly
down,
so
suddenly
that
Alice
had
not
a
moment
to
think
about
stopping
herself
before
she
found
herself
falling
down
a
very
deep
well.
Either
the
well
was
very
deep,
or
she
fell
very
slowly,
for
she
had
plenty
of
time
as
she
went
down
to
look
about
her
and
to
wonder
what
was
going
to
happen
next.
First,
she
tried
to
look
down
and
make
out
what
she
was
coming
to,
but
it
was
too
dark
to
see
anything;
then
she
looked
at
the
sides
of
the
well,
and
noticed
that
they
were
filled
with
cupboards
and
book-shelves;
ere
and
there
she
saw
maps
and
pictures
hung
upon
pegs.
She
took
down
a
jar
from
one
of
the
shelves
as
she
passed;
it
was
labelled
‘ORANGE
RMALADE’,
to
her
great
disappointment
it
was
empty:
she
did
not
like
to
drop
the
jar
for
fear
of
killing
somebody,
so
managed
to
put
it
into
one
of
the
cupboards
as
she
fell
past
it.
‘Well!’
t
Alice
to
herself,
‘after
ch
a
fall
as
this,
I
shall
think
nothing
of
tumbling
down
stairs!
How
brave
they’ll
l
think
me
at
home!
Why,
I
wouldn’t
y
anything
about
it,
even
if
I
fell
off
the
top
of
the
house!’
ich
was
very
likely
true.)
Down,
down,
down.
Would
the
fall
NEVER
come
to
an
end!
‘I
nder
how
many
miles
I’ve
llen
by
this
time?’
said
aloud.
‘I
st
be
getting
somewhere
near
the
centre
of
the
earth.
Let
me
see:
that
would
be
four
thousand
miles
down,
I
think--’
,
you
see,
Alice
had
learnt
several
things
of
this
sort
in
her
lessons
in
the
schoolroom,
and
though
this
was
not
a
VERY
good
opportunity
for
showing
off
her
knowledge,
as
there
was
no
one
to
listen
to
her,
still
it
was
good
practice
to
say
it
over)
‘--yes,
s
bout
the
right
distance--but
hen
I
wonder
what
Latitude
or
Longitude
I’ve
t
to?’
ice
had
no
idea
what
Latitude
was,
or
Longitude
either,
but
thought
they
were
nice
grand
words
to
say.)
Presently
she
began
again.
‘I
nder
if
I
shall
fall
right
THROUGH
the
earth!
How
funny
it’ll
em
to
come
out
among
the
people
that
walk
with
their
heads
downward!
The
Antipathies,
I
think--’
was
rather
glad
there
WAS
no
one
listening,
this
time,
as
it
didn’t
und
at
all
the
right
word)
‘--but
all
have
to
ask
them
what
the
name
of
the
country
is,
you
know.
Please,
Ma’am,
this
New
Zealand
or
Australia?’
d
she
tried
to
curtsey
as
she
spoke--fancy
URTSEYING
as
you’re
lling
through
the
air!
Do
you
think
you
could
manage
it?)
And
hat
an
ignorant
little
girl
she’ll
ink
me
for
asking!
No,
it’ll
ver
do
to
ask:
perhaps
I
shall
see
it
written
up
somewhere.’
Down,
down,
down.
There
was
nothing
else
to
do,
so
Alice
soon
began
talking
again.
‘Dinah’ll
me
very
much
to-night,
should
think!’
inah
was
the
cat.)
I
ope
they’ll
member
her
saucer
of
milk
at
tea-time.
inah
my
dear!
I
wish
you
were
down
here
with
me!
There
are
no
mice
in
the
air,
I’m
raid,
but
you
might
catch
a
bat,
and
that’s
ry
like
a
mouse,
you
know.
But
do
cats
eat
bats,
I
wonder?’
here
Alice
began
to
get
rather
sleepy,
and
went
on
saying
to
herself,
in
a
dreamy
sort
of
way,
‘Do
ts
eat
bats?
Do
cats
eat
bats?’
sometimes,
‘Do
ats
eat
cats?’
,
you
see,
as
she
couldn’t
swer
either
question,
it
didn’t
ch
matter
which
way
she
put
it.
She
felt
that
she
was
dozing
off,
and
had
just
begun
to
dream
that
she
was
walking
hand
in
hand
with
Dinah,
and
saying
to
her
very
earnestly,
‘Now,
ah,
tell
me
the
truth:
did
you
ever
eat
a
bat?’
n
suddenly,
thump!
thump!
down
she
came
upon
a
heap
of
sticks
and
dry
leaves,
and
the
fall
was
over.
Alice
was
not
a
bit
hurt,
and
she
jumped
up
on
to
her
feet
in
a
moment:
she
looked
up,
but
it
was
all
dark
overhead;
before
her
was
another
long
passage,
and
the
White
Rabbit
was
still
in
sight,
hurrying
down
it.
There
was
not
a
moment
to
be
lost:
away
went
Alice
like
the
wind,
and
was
just
in
time
to
hear
it
say,
as
it
turned
a
corner,
‘Oh
ears
and
whiskers,
how
late
it’s
tting!’
was
close
behind
it
when
she
turned
the
corner,
but
the
Rabbit
was
no
longer
to
be
seen:
she
found
herself
in
a
long,
low
hall,
which
was
lit
up
by
a
row
of
lamps
hanging
from
the
roof.
There
were
doors
all
round
the
hall,
but
they
were
all
locked;
and
when
Alice
had
been
all
the
way
down
one
side
and
up
the
other,
trying
every
door,
she
walked
sadly
down
the
middle,
wondering
how
she
was
ever
to
get
out
again.
Suddenly
she
came
upon
a
little
three-legged
table,
all
made
of
solid
glass;
there
was
nothing
on
it
except
a
tiny
golden
key,
and
Alice’s
irst
thought
was
that
it
might
belong
to
one
of
the
doors
of
the
hall;
but,
alas!
either
the
locks
were
too
large,
or
the
key
was
too
small,
but
at
any
rate
it
would
not
open
any
of
them.
However,
on
the
second
time
round,
she
came
upon
a
low
curtain
she
had
not
noticed
before,
and
behind
it
was
a
little
door
about
fifteen
inches
high:
she
tried
the
little
golden
key
in
the
lock,
and
to
her
great
delight
it
fitted!
Alice
opened
the
door
and
found
that
it
led
into
a
small
passage,
not
much
larger
than
a
rat-hole:
he
knelt
down
and
looked
along
the
passage
into
the
loveliest
garden
you
ever
saw.
How
she
longed
to
get
out
of
that
dark
hall,
and
wander
about
among
those
beds
of
bright
flowers
and
those
cool
fountains,
but
she
could
not
even
get
her
head
through
the
doorway;
‘and
en
if
my
head
would
go
through,’
ught
poor
Alice,
‘it
ould
be
of
very
little
use
without
my
shoulders.
Oh,
how
I
wish
I
could
shut
up
like
a
telescope!
I
think
I
could,
if
I
only
knew
how
to
begin.’
r,
you
see,
so
many
out-of-the-way
ings
had
happened
lately,
that
Alice
had
begun
to
think
that
very
few
things
indeed
were
really
impossible.
There
seemed
to
be
no
use
in
waiting
by
the
little
door,
so
she
went
back
to
the
table,
half
hoping
she
might
find
another
key
on
it,
or
at
any
rate
a
book
of
rules
for
shutting
people
up
like
telescopes:
this
time
she
found
a
little
bottle
on
it,
[‘which
tainly
was
not
here
before,’
d
Alice,)
nd
round
the
neck
of
the
bottle
was
a
paper
label,
with
the
words
‘DRINK
’
autifully
printed
on
it
in
large
letters.
It
was
all
very
well
to
say
‘Drink
,’
the
wise
little
Alice
was
not
going
to
do
THAT
in
a
hurry.
‘No,
ll
look
first,’
said,
‘and
ee
whether
it’s
rked
“poison”
t’;
she
had
read
several
nice
little
histories
about
children
who
had
got
burnt,
and
eaten
up
by
wild
beasts
and
other
unpleasant
things,
all
because
they
WOULD
not
remember
the
simple
rules
their
friends
had
taught
them:
such
as,
that
a
red-hot
poker
will
burn
you
if
you
hold
it
too
long;
and
that
if
you
cut
your
finger
VERY
deeply
with
a
knife,
it
usually
bleeds;
and
she
had
never
forgotten
that,
if
you
drink
much
from
a
bottle
marked
‘poison,’
almost
certain
to
disagree
with
you,
sooner
or
later.
However,
this
bottle
was
NOT
marked
‘poison,’
ce
ventured
to
taste
it,
and
finding
it
very
nice,
(it
had,
in
fact,
a
sort
of
mixed
flavour
of
cherry-tart,
ustard,
pine-apple,
oast
turkey,
toffee,
and
hot
buttered
toast,)
he
very
soon
finished
it
off.

‘What
curious
feeling!’
d
Alice;
‘I
st
be
shutting
up
like
a
telescope.’
And
so
it
was
indeed:
she
was
now
only
ten
inches
high,
and
her
face
brightened
up
at
the
thought
that
she
was
now
the
right
size
for
going
through
the
little
door
into
that
lovely
garden.
First,
however,
she
waited
for
a
few
minutes
to
see
if
she
was
going
to
shrink
any
further:
she
felt
a
little
nervous
about
this;
‘for
might
end,
you
know,’
d
Alice
to
herself,
‘in
going
out
altogether,
like
a
candle.
I
wonder
what
I
should
be
like
then?’
she
tried
to
fancy
what
the
flame
of
a
candle
is
like
after
the
candle
is
blown
out,
for
she
could
not
remember
ever
having
seen
such
a
thing.
After
a
while,
finding
that
nothing
more
happened,
she
decided
on
going
into
the
garden
at
once;
but,
alas
for
poor
Alice!
when
she
got
to
the
door,
she
found
she
had
forgotten
the
little
golden
key,
and
when
she
went
back
to
the
table
for
it,
she
found
she
could
not
possibly
reach
it:
she
could
see
it
quite
plainly
through
the
glass,
and
she
tried
her
best
to
climb
up
one
of
the
legs
of
the
table,
but
it
was
too
slippery;
and
when
she
had
tired
herself
out
with
trying,
the
poor
little
thing
sat
down
and
cried.
‘Come,
re’s
use
in
crying
like
that!’
d
Alice
to
herself,
rather
sharply;
‘I
vise
you
to
leave
off
this
minute!’
generally
gave
herself
very
good
advice,
(though
she
very
seldom
followed
it),
and
sometimes
she
scolded
herself
so
severely
as
to
bring
tears
into
her
eyes;
and
once
she
remembered
trying
to
box
her
own
ears
for
having
cheated
herself
in
a
game
of
croquet
she
was
playing
against
herself,
for
this
curious
child
was
very
fond
of
pretending
to
be
two
people.
‘But
’s
use
now,’
ught
poor
Alice,
‘to
etend
to
be
two
people!
Why,
there’s
rdly
enough
of
me
left
to
make
ONE
respectable
person!’
Soon
her
eye
fell
on
a
little
glass
box
that
was
lying
under
the
table:
she
opened
it,
and
found
in
it
a
very
small
cake,
on
which
the
words
‘EAT
’
re
beautifully
marked
in
currants.
‘Well,
ll
eat
it,’
d
Alice,
‘and
it
makes
me
grow
larger,
I
can
reach
the
key;
and
if
it
makes
me
grow
smaller,
I
can
creep
under
the
door;
so
either
way
I’ll
et
into
the
garden,
and
I
don’t
re
which
happens!’
She
ate
a
little
bit,
and
said
anxiously
to
herself,
‘Which
y?
Which
way?’,
ing
her
hand
on
the
top
of
her
head
to
feel
which
way
it
was
growing,
and
she
was
quite
surprised
to
find
that
she
remained
the
same
size:
to
be
sure,
this
generally
happens
when
one
eats
cake,
but
Alice
had
got
so
much
into
the
way
of
expecting
nothing
but
out-of-the-way
hings
to
happen,
that
it
seemed
quite
dull
and
stupid
for
life
to
go
on
in
the
common
way.
So
she
set
to
work,
and
very
soon
finished
off
the
cake.

CHAPTER
II.
The
Pool
of
Tears
‘Curiouser
d
curiouser!’
ed
Alice
(she
was
so
much
surprised,
that
for
the
moment
she
quite
forgot
how
to
speak
good
English);
now
’m
pening
out
like
the
largest
telescope
that
ever
was!
Good-bye,
eet!’
or
when
she
looked
down
at
her
feet,
they
seemed
to
be
almost
out
of
sight,
they
were
getting
so
far
off).
Oh,
poor
little
feet,
I
wonder
who
will
put
on
your
shoes
and
stockings
for
you
now,
dears?
I’m
re
_I_
han’t
able!
I
shall
be
a
great
deal
too
far
off
to
trouble
myself
about
you:
you
must
manage
the
best
way
you
can;--but
must
be
kind
to
them,’
ught
Alice,
‘or
rhaps
they
won’t
lk
the
way
I
want
to
go!
Let
me
see:
I’ll
ve
them
a
new
pair
of
boots
every
Christmas.’
And
she
went
on
planning
to
herself
how
she
would
manage
it.
‘They
st
go
by
the
carrier,’
thought;
‘and
w
funny
it’ll
em,
sending
presents
to
one’s
n
feet!
And
how
odd
the
directions
will
look!
ALICE’S
GHT
FOOT,
ESQ.
HEARTHRUG,
NEAR
THE
FENDER,
(WITH
ALICE’S
VE).
Oh
dear,
what
nonsense
I’m
lking!’
Just
then
her
head
struck
against
the
roof
of
the
hall:
in
fact
she
was
now
more
than
nine
feet
high,
and
she
at
once
took
up
the
little
golden
key
and
hurried
off
to
the
garden
door.
Poor
Alice!
It
was
as
much
as
she
could
do,
lying
down
on
one
side,
to
look
through
into
the
garden
with
one
eye;
but
to
get
through
was
more
hopeless
than
ever:
she
sat
down
and
began
to
cry
again.
‘You
ght
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself,’
d
Alice,
‘a
eat
girl
like
you,’
e
might
well
say
this),
to
o
on
crying
in
this
way!
Stop
this
moment,
I
tell
you!’
she
went
on
all
the
same,
shedding
gallons
of
tears,
until
there
was
a
large
pool
all
round
her,
about
four
inches
deep
and
reaching
half
down
the
hall.
After
a
time
she
heard
a
little
pattering
of
feet
in
the
distance,
and
she
hastily
dried
her
eyes
to
see
what
was
coming.
It
was
the
White
Rabbit
returning,
splendidly
dressed,
with
a
pair
of
white
kid
gloves
in
one
hand
and
a
large
fan
in
the
other:
he
came
trotting
along
in
a
great
hurry,
muttering
to
himself
as
he
came,
‘Oh!
Duchess,
the
Duchess!
Oh!
won’t
e
be
savage
if
I’ve
pt
her
waiting!’
ce
felt
so
desperate
that
she
was
ready
to
ask
help
of
any
one;
so,
when
the
Rabbit
came
near
her,
she
began,
in
a
low,
timid
voice,
‘If
u
please,
sir--’
Rabbit
started
violently,
dropped
the
white
kid
gloves
and
the
fan,
and
skurried
away
into
the
darkness
as
hard
as
he
could
go.
Alice
took
up
the
fan
and
gloves,
and,
as
the
hall
was
very
hot,
she
kept
fanning
herself
all
the
time
she
went
on
talking:
‘Dear,
r!
How
queer
everything
is
to-day!
nd
yesterday
things
went
on
just
as
usual.
I
wonder
if
I’ve
en
changed
in
the
night?
Let
me
think:
was
I
the
same
when
I
got
up
this
morning?
I
almost
think
I
can
remember
feeling
a
little
different.
But
if
I’m
t
the
same,
the
next
question
is,
Who
in
the
world
am
I?
Ah,
THAT’S
e
great
puzzle!’
she
began
thinking
over
all
the
children
she
knew
that
were
of
the
same
age
as
herself,
to
see
if
she
could
have
been
changed
for
any
of
them.
‘I’m
I’m
t
Ada,’
said,
‘for
r
hair
goes
in
such
long
ringlets,
and
mine
doesn’t
in
ringlets
at
all;
and
I’m
re
I
can’t
e

for
I
know
all
sorts
of

and
she,
oh!
she
knows
such
a
very
little!
Besides,
SHE’S

and
I’m
and--oh
ear,
how
puzzling
it
all
is!
I’ll
y
if
I
know
all
the
things
I
used
to
know.
Let
me
see:
four
times
five
is
twelve,
and
four
times
six
is
thirteen,
and
four
times
seven
is--oh
ear!
I
shall
never
get
to
twenty
at
that
rate!
However,
the
Multiplication

doesn’t

I
must
have

“How

crossed
her
hands
on
her
lap
as
if
she
were
saying
lessons,
and
began
to
repeat
it,
but
her
voice
sounded
hoarse
and
strange,
and
the
words
did
not
come
the
same
as
they
used
to
do:--
‘How
th
the
little
crocodile
Improve
his
shining
tail,
And
pour
the
waters
of
the
Nile
On
every
golden
scale!
‘How
eerfully
he
seems
to
grin,
How
neatly
spread
his
claws,
And
welcome
little
fishes
in
With
gently
smiling
jaws!’
‘I’m
those
are
not
the
right
words,’
d
poor
Alice,
and
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
again
as
she
went
on,
‘I
st
be
Mabel
after
all,
and
I
shall
have
to
go
and
live
in
that
poky
little
house,
and
have
next
to
no
toys
to
play
with,
and
oh!
ever
so
many
lessons
to
learn!
No,
I’ve
ade
up
my
mind
about
it;
if
I’m
bel,
I’ll
ay
down
here!
It’ll
no
use
their
putting
their
heads
down
and
saying
“Come

dear!”
shall
only
look
up
and
say
“Who

Tell

first,
and
then,
if
I

person,
I’ll
me
up:
if

I’ll
ay
down
here
till
I’m

ar!’
ed
Alice,
with
a
sudden
burst
of
tears,
‘I
wish
they
WOULD
put
their
heads
down!
I
am
so
VERY
tired
of
being
all
alone
here!’
As
she
said
this
she
looked
down
at
her
hands,
and
was
surprised
to
see
that
she
had
put
on
one
of
the
Rabbit’s
ttle
white
kid
gloves
while
she
was
talking.
‘How
N
I
have
done
that?’
thought.
‘I
st
be
growing
small
again.’
got
up
and
went
to
the
table
to
measure
herself
by
it,
and
found
that,
as
nearly
as
she
could
guess,
she
was
now
about
two
feet
high,
and
was
going
on
shrinking
rapidly:
she
soon
found
out
that
the
cause
of
this
was
the
fan
she
was
holding,
and
she
dropped
it
hastily,
just
in
time
to
avoid
shrinking
away
altogether.
‘That
S
a
narrow
escape!’
d
Alice,
a
good
deal
frightened
at
the
sudden
change,
but
very
glad
to
find
herself
still
in
existence;
‘and
ow
for
the
garden!’
she
ran
with
all
speed
back
to
the
little
door:
but,
alas!
the
little
door
was
shut
again,
and
the
little
golden
key
was
lying
on
the
glass
table
as
before,
‘and
ings
are
worse
than
ever,’
ought
the
poor
child,
‘for
never
was
so
small
as
this
before,
never!
And
I
declare
it’s
o
bad,
that
it
is!’
As
she
said
these
words
her
foot
slipped,
and
in
another
moment,
splash!
she
was
up
to
her
chin
in
salt
water.
Her
first
idea
was
that
she
had
somehow
fallen
into
the
sea,
‘and
that
case
I
can
go
back
by
railway,’
said
to
herself.
(Alice
had
been
to
the
seaside
once
in
her
life,
and
had
come
to
the
general
conclusion,
that
wherever
you
go
to
on
the
English
coast
you
find
a
number
of
bathing
machines
in
the
sea,
some
children
digging
in
the
sand
with
wooden
spades,
then
a
row
of
lodging
houses,
and
behind
them
a
railway
station.)
owever,
she
soon
made
out
that
she
was
in
the
pool
of
tears
which
she
had
wept
when
she
was
nine
feet
high.
‘I
sh
I
hadn’t
ied
so
much!’
d
Alice,
as
she
swam
about,
trying
to
find
her
way
out.
‘I
all
be
punished
for
it
now,
I
suppose,
by
being
drowned
in
my
own
tears!
That
WILL
be
a
queer
thing,
to
be
sure!
However,
everything
is
queer
to-day.’
ust
then
she
heard
something
splashing
about
in
the
pool
a
little
way
off,
and
she
swam
nearer
to
make
out
what
it
was:
at
first
she
thought
it
must
be
a
walrus
or
hippopotamus,
but
then
she
remembered
how
small
she
was
now,
and
she
soon
made
out
that
it
was
only
a
mouse
that
had
slipped
in
like
herself.
‘Would
be
of
any
use,
now,’
ught
Alice,
‘to
eak
to
this
mouse?
Everything
is
so
out-of-the-way
wn
here,
that
I
should
think
very
likely
it
can
talk:
at
any
rate,
there’s
harm
in
trying.’
she
began:
‘O
use,
do
you
know
the
way
out
of
this
pool?
I
am
very
tired
of
swimming
about
here,
O
Mouse!’
ice
thought
this
must
be
the
right
way
of
speaking
to
a
mouse:
she
had
never
done
such
a
thing
before,
but
she
remembered
having
seen
in
her
brother’s
tin
Grammar,
‘A
use--of
a
mouse--to
mouse--a
ouse--O
ouse!’)
Mouse
looked
at
her
rather
inquisitively,
and
seemed
to
her
to
wink
with
one
of
its
little
eyes,
but
it
said
nothing.
‘Perhaps
doesn’t
derstand
English,’
ught
Alice;
‘I
resay
it’s
French
mouse,
come
over
with
William
the
Conqueror.’
r,
with
all
her
knowledge
of
history,
Alice
had
no
very
clear
notion
how
long
ago
anything
had
happened.)
o
she
began
again:
‘Ou
t
ma
chatte?’
ch
was
the
first
sentence
in
her
French
lesson-book.
he
Mouse
gave
a
sudden
leap
out
of
the
water,
and
seemed
to
quiver
all
over
with
fright.
‘Oh,
eg
your
pardon!’
ed
Alice
hastily,
afraid
that
she
had
hurt
the
poor
animal’s
elings.
‘I
ite
forgot
you
didn’t
ke
cats.’
‘Not
ke
cats!’
ed
the
Mouse,
in
a
shrill,
passionate
voice.
‘Would
OU
like
cats
if
you
were
me?’
‘Well,
haps
not,’
d
Alice
in
a
soothing
tone:
‘don’t
gry
about
it.
And
yet
I
wish
I
could
show
you
our
cat
Dinah:
I
think
you’d
ake
a
fancy
to
cats
if
you
could
only
see
her.
She
is
such
a
dear
quiet
thing,’
ce
went
on,
half
to
herself,
as
she
swam
lazily
about
in
the
pool,
‘and
e
sits
purring
so
nicely
by
the
fire,
licking
her
paws
and
washing
her
face--and
he
is
such
a
nice
soft
thing
to
nurse--and
he’s
uch
a
capital
one
for
catching
mice--oh,
beg
your
pardon!’
ed
Alice
again,
for
this
time
the
Mouse
was
bristling
all
over,
and
she
felt
certain
it
must
be
really
offended.
‘We
n’t
lk
about
her
any
more
if
you’d
ther
not.’
‘We
deed!’
ed
the
Mouse,
who
was
trembling
down
to
the
end
of
his
tail.
‘As
I
would
talk
on
such
a
subject!
Our
family
always
HATED
cats:
nasty,
low,
vulgar
things!
Don’t
t
me
hear
the
name
again!’
‘I
n’t
deed!’
d
Alice,
in
a
great
hurry
to
change
the
subject
of
conversation.
‘Are
u--are
ou
fond--of--of
s?’
Mouse
did
not
answer,
so
Alice
went
on
eagerly:
‘There
such
a
nice
little
dog
near
our
house
I
should
like
to
show
you!
A
little
bright-eyed
terrier,
you
know,
with
oh,
such
long
curly
brown
hair!
And
it’ll
tch
things
when
you
throw
them,
and
it’ll
t
up
and
beg
for
its
dinner,
and
all
sorts
of
things--I
an’t
member
half
of
them--and
t
belongs
to
a
farmer,
you
know,
and
he
says
it’s
useful,
it’s
rth
a
hundred
pounds!
He
says
it
kills
all
the
rats
and--oh
ear!’
ed
Alice
in
a
sorrowful
tone,
‘I’m
d
I’ve
fended
it
again!’
the
Mouse
was
swimming
away
from
her
as
hard
as
it
could
go,
and
making
quite
a
commotion
in
the
pool
as
it
went.
So
she
called
softly
after
it,
‘Mouse
ar!
Do
come
back
again,
and
we
won’t
lk
about
cats
or
dogs
either,
if
you
don’t
ke
them!’
n
the
Mouse
heard
this,
it
turned
round
and
swam
slowly
back
to
her:
its
face
was
quite
pale
(with
passion,
Alice
thought),
nd
it
said
in
a
low
trembling
voice,
‘Let
get
to
the
shore,
and
then
I’ll
ll
you
my
history,
and
you’ll
derstand
why
it
is
I
hate
cats
and
dogs.’
It
was
high
time
to
go,
for
the
pool
was
getting
quite
crowded
with
the
birds
and
animals
that
had
fallen
into
it:
there
were
a
Duck
and
a
Dodo,
a
Lory
and
an
Eaglet,
and
several
other
curious
creatures.
Alice
led
the
way,
and
the
whole
party
swam
to
the
shore.
CHAPTER
III.
A
Caucus-Race
and
a
Long
Tale
They
were
indeed
a
queer-looking
party
that
assembled
on
the
bank--the
birds
with
draggled
feathers,
the
animals
with
their
fur
clinging
close
to
them,
and
all
dripping
wet,
cross,
and
uncomfortable.
The
first
question
of
course
was,
how
to
get
dry
again:
they
had
a
consultation
about
this,
and
after
a
few
minutes
it
seemed
quite
natural
to
Alice
to
find
herself
talking
familiarly
with
them,
as
if
she
had
known
them
all
her
life.
Indeed,
she
had
quite
a
long
argument
with
the
Lory,
who
at
last
turned
sulky,
and
would
only
say,
‘I
older
than
you,
and
must
know
better’;
this
Alice
would
not
allow
without
knowing
how
old
it
was,
and,
as
the
Lory
positively
refused
to
tell
its
age,
there
was
no
more
to
be
said.
At
last
the
Mouse,
who
seemed
to
be
a
person
of
authority
among
them,
called
out,
‘Sit
wn,
all
of
you,
and
listen
to
me!
I’LL
on
make
you
dry
enough!’
y
all
sat
down
at
once,
in
a
large
ring,
with
the
Mouse
in
the
middle.
Alice
kept
her
eyes
anxiously
fixed
on
it,
for
she
felt
sure
she
would
catch
a
bad
cold
if
she
did
not
get
dry
very
soon.
‘Ahem!’
he
Mouse
with
an
important
air,
‘are
u
all
ready?
This
is
the
driest
thing
I
know.
Silence
all
round,
if
you
please!
“William
he
Conqueror,
whose
cause
was
favoured
by
the
pope,
was
soon
submitted
to
by
the
English,
who
wanted
leaders,
and
had
been
of
late
much
accustomed
to
usurpation
and
conquest.
Edwin
and
Morcar,
the
earls
of
Mercia
and
Northumbria--“’
gh!’
d
the
Lory,
with
a
shiver.
‘I
g
your
pardon!’
d
the
Mouse,
frowning,
but
very
politely:
‘Did
ou
speak?’
‘Not
’
id
the
Lory
hastily.
‘I
ought
you
did,’
d
the
Mouse.
‘--I
eed.
“Edwin
d
Morcar,
the
earls
of
Mercia
and
Northumbria,
declared
for
him:
and
even
Stigand,
the
patriotic
archbishop
of
Canterbury,
found
it
advisable--“’
ound
WHAT?’
d
the
Duck.
‘Found
,’
Mouse
replied
rather
crossly:
‘of
urse
you
know
what
“it”
.’
‘I
ow
what
“it”
well
enough,
when
I
find
a
thing,’
d
the
Duck:
‘it’s
ally
a
frog
or
a
worm.
The
question
is,
what
did
the
archbishop
find?’
The
Mouse
did
not
notice
this
question,
but
hurriedly
went
on,
‘“--found
isable
to
go
with
Edgar
Atheling
to
meet
William
and
offer
him
the
crown.
William’s
nduct
at
first
was
moderate.
But
the
insolence
of
his
Normans--”
are
you
getting
on
now,
my
dear?’
continued,
turning
to
Alice
as
it
spoke.
‘As
t
as
ever,’
d
Alice
in
a
melancholy
tone:
‘it
esn’t
em
to
dry
me
at
all.’
‘In
at
case,’
d
the
Dodo
solemnly,
rising
to
its
feet,
‘I
ve
that
the
meeting
adjourn,
for
the
immediate
adoption
of
more
energetic
remedies--’
Speak
nglish!’
d
the
Eaglet.
‘I
n’t
ow
the
meaning
of
half
those
long
words,
and,
what’s
re,
I
don’t
lieve
you
do
either!’
the
Eaglet
bent
down
its
head
to
hide
a
smile:
some
of
the
other
birds
tittered
audibly.
‘What
was
going
to
say,’
d
the
Dodo
in
an
offended
tone,
‘was,
t
the
best
thing
to
get
us
dry
would
be
a
Caucus-race.’
What
S
a
Caucus-race?’
Alice;
not
that
she
wanted
much
to
know,
but
the
Dodo
had
paused
as
if
it
thought
that
SOMEBODY
ought
to
speak,
and
no
one
else
seemed
inclined
to
say
anything.
‘Why,’
he
Dodo,
‘the
st
way
to
explain
it
is
to
do
it.’
d,
as
you
might
like
to
try
the
thing
yourself,
some
winter
day,
I
will
tell
you
how
the
Dodo
managed
it.)
First
it
marked
out
a
race-course,
n
a
sort
of
circle,
[‘the
ct
shape
doesn’t
tter,’
said,)
nd
then
all
the
party
were
placed
along
the
course,
here
and
there.
There
was
no
‘One,
,
three,
and
away,’
they
began
running
when
they
liked,
and
left
off
when
they
liked,
so
that
it
was
not
easy
to
know
when
the
race
was
over.
However,
when
they
had
been
running
half
an
hour
or
so,
and
were
quite
dry
again,
the
Dodo
suddenly
called
out
‘The
ce
is
over!’
they
all
crowded
round
it,
panting,
and
asking,
‘But
o
has
won?’
This
question
the
Dodo
could
not
answer
without
a
great
deal
of
thought,
and
it
sat
for
a
long
time
with
one
finger
pressed
upon
its
forehead
(the
position
in
which
you
usually
see
Shakespeare,
in
the
pictures
of
him),
hile
the
rest
waited
in
silence.
At
last
the
Dodo
said,
‘EVERYBODY
s
won,
and
all
must
have
prizes.’
‘But
o
is
to
give
the
prizes?’
te
a
chorus
of
voices
asked.
‘Why,
,
of
course,’
d
the
Dodo,
pointing
to
Alice
with
one
finger;
and
the
whole
party
at
once
crowded
round
her,
calling
out
in
a
confused
way,
‘Prizes!
zes!’
Alice
had
no
idea
what
to
do,
and
in
despair
she
put
her
hand
in
her
pocket,
and
pulled
out
a
box
of
comfits,
(luckily
the
salt
water
had
not
got
into
it),
nd
handed
them
round
as
prizes.
There
was
exactly
one
a-piece
all
round.
‘But
e
must
have
a
prize
herself,
you
know,’
d
the
Mouse.
‘Of
urse,’
Dodo
replied
very
gravely.
‘What
se
have
you
got
in
your
pocket?’
went
on,
turning
to
Alice.
‘Only
thimble,’
d
Alice
sadly.
‘Hand
over
here,’
d
the
Dodo.
Then
they
all
crowded
round
her
once
more,
while
the
Dodo
solemnly
presented
the
thimble,
saying
‘We
g
your
acceptance
of
this
elegant
thimble’;
,
when
it
had
finished
this
short
speech,
they
all
cheered.
Alice
thought
the
whole
thing
very
absurd,
but
they
all
looked
so
grave
that
she
did
not
dare
to
laugh;
and,
as
she
could
not
think
of
anything
to
say,
she
simply
bowed,
and
took
the
thimble,
looking
as
solemn
as
she
could.
The
next
thing
was
to
eat
the
comfits:
this
caused
some
noise
and
confusion,
as
the
large
birds
complained
that
they
could
not
taste
theirs,
and
the
small
ones
choked
and
had
to
be
patted
on
the
back.
However,
it
was
over
at
last,
and
they
sat
down
again
in
a
ring,
and
begged
the
Mouse
to
tell
them
something
more.
‘You
omised
to
tell
me
your
history,
you
know,’
d
Alice,
‘and
y
it
is
you
hate--C
nd
D,’
added
in
a
whisper,
half
afraid
that
it
would
be
offended
again.
‘Mine
a
long
and
a
sad
tale!’
d
the
Mouse,
turning
to
Alice,
and
sighing.
‘It
a
long
tail,
certainly,’
d
Alice,
looking
down
with
wonder
at
the
Mouse’s
il;
‘but
y
do
you
call
it
sad?’
she
kept
on
puzzling
about
it
while
the
Mouse
was
speaking,
so
that
her
idea
of
the
tale
was
something
like
this:--
‘Fury
id
to
a
mouse,
That
he
met
in
the
house,
“Let
both
go
to
law:
I
will
prosecute
YOU.--Come,
I’ll
ke
no
denial;
We
must
have
a
trial:
For
really
this
morning
I’ve
nothing
to
do.”
Said
the
mouse
to
the
cur,
“Such
a
trial,
dear
Sir,
With
no
jury
or
judge,
would
be
wasting
our
breath.”
“I’ll
judge,
I’ll
be
jury,”
Said
cunning
old
Fury:
“I’ll
try
the
whole
cause,
and
condemn
you
to
death.”’
You
re
not
attending!’
d
the
Mouse
to
Alice
severely.
‘What
e
you
thinking
of?’
‘I
g
your
pardon,’
d
Alice
very
humbly:
‘you
d
got
to
the
fifth
bend,
I
think?’
‘I
d
NOT!’
ed
the
Mouse,
sharply
and
very
angrily.
‘A
ot!’
d
Alice,
always
ready
to
make
herself
useful,
and
looking
anxiously
about
her.
‘Oh,
let
me
help
to
undo
it!’
‘I
all
do
nothing
of
the
sort,’
d
the
Mouse,
getting
up
and
walking
away.
‘You
sult
me
by
talking
such
nonsense!’
‘I
dn’t
an
it!’
aded
poor
Alice.
‘But
u’re
easily
offended,
you
know!’
The
Mouse
only
growled
in
reply.
‘Please
me
back
and
finish
your
story!’
ce
called
after
it;
and
the
others
all
joined
in
chorus,
‘Yes,
ase
do!’
the
Mouse
only
shook
its
head
impatiently,
and
walked
a
little
quicker.
‘What
pity
it
wouldn’t
ay!’
hed
the
Lory,
as
soon
as
it
was
quite
out
of
sight;
and
an
old
Crab
took
the
opportunity
of
saying
to
her
daughter
‘Ah,
dear!
Let
this
be
a
lesson
to
you
never
to
lose
YOUR
temper!’
Hold
your
tongue,
Ma!’
d
the
young
Crab,
a
little
snappishly.
‘You’re
h
to
try
the
patience
of
an
oyster!’
‘I
sh
I
had
our
Dinah
here,
I
know
I
do!’
d
Alice
aloud,
addressing
nobody
in
particular.
‘She’d
fetch
it
back!’
‘And
o
is
Dinah,
if
I
might
venture
to
ask
the
question?’
d
the
Lory.
Alice
replied
eagerly,
for
she
was
always
ready
to
talk
about
her
pet:
‘Dinah’s
at.
And
she’s
ch
a
capital
one
for
catching
mice
you
can’t
ink!
And
oh,
I
wish
you
could
see
her
after
the
birds!
Why,
she’ll
t
a
little
bird
as
soon
as
look
at
it!’
This
speech
caused
a
remarkable
sensation
among
the
party.
Some
of
the
birds
hurried
off
at
once:
one
old
Magpie
began
wrapping
itself
up
very
carefully,
remarking,
‘I
ally
must
be
getting
home;
the
night-air
doesn’t
it
my
throat!’
a
Canary
called
out
in
a
trembling
voice
to
its
children,
‘Come
ay,
my
dears!
It’s
gh
time
you
were
all
in
bed!’
various
pretexts
they
all
moved
off,
and
Alice
was
soon
left
alone.
‘I
sh
I
hadn’t
ntioned
Dinah!’
said
to
herself
in
a
melancholy
tone.
‘Nobody
ems
to
like
her,
down
here,
and
I’m
re
she’s
e
best
cat
in
the
world!
Oh,
my
dear
Dinah!
I
wonder
if
I
shall
ever
see
you
any
more!’
here
poor
Alice
began
to
cry
again,
for
she
felt
very
lonely
and
low-spirited.
n
a
little
while,
however,
she
again
heard
a
little
pattering
of
footsteps
in
the
distance,
and
she
looked
up
eagerly,
half
hoping
that
the
Mouse
had
changed
his
mind,
and
was
coming
back
to
finish
his
story.
CHAPTER
IV.
The
Rabbit
Sends
in
a
Little
Bill
It
was
the
White
Rabbit,
trotting
slowly
back
again,
and
looking
anxiously
about
as
it
went,
as
if
it
had
lost
something;
and
she
heard
it
muttering
to
itself
‘The
chess!
The
Duchess!
Oh
my
dear
paws!
Oh
my
fur
and
whiskers!
She’ll
t
me
executed,
as
sure
as
ferrets
are
ferrets!
Where
CAN
I
have
dropped
them,
I
wonder?’
ce
guessed
in
a
moment
that
it
was
looking
for
the
fan
and
the
pair
of
white
kid
gloves,
and
she
very
good-naturedly
began
hunting
about
for
them,
but
they
were
nowhere
to
be
seen--everything
eemed
to
have
changed
since
her
swim
in
the
pool,
and
the
great
hall,
with
the
glass
table
and
the
little
door,
had
vanished
completely.
Very
soon
the
Rabbit
noticed
Alice,
as
she
went
hunting
about,
and
called
out
to
her
in
an
angry
tone,
‘Why,
y
Ann,
what
ARE
you
doing
out
here?
Run
home
this
moment,
and
fetch
me
a
pair
of
gloves
and
a
fan!
Quick,
now!’
Alice
was
so
much
frightened
that
she
ran
off
at
once
in
the
direction
it
pointed
to,
without
trying
to
explain
the
mistake
it
had
made.
‘He
ok
me
for
his
housemaid,’
said
to
herself
as
she
ran.
‘How
urprised
he’ll
when
he
finds
out
who
I
am!
But
I’d
tter
take
him
his
fan
and
gloves--that
s,
if
I
can
find
them.’
she
said
this,
she
came
upon
a
neat
little
house,
on
the
door
of
which
was
a
bright
brass
plate
with
the
name
‘W.
BIT’
graved
upon
it.
She
went
in
without
knocking,
and
hurried
upstairs,
in
great
fear
lest
she
should
meet
the
real
Mary
Ann,
and
be
turned
out
of
the
house
before
she
had
found
the
fan
and
gloves.
‘How
eer
it
seems,’
ce
said
to
herself,
‘to
going
messages
for
a
rabbit!
I
suppose
Dinah’ll
sending
me
on
messages
next!’
she
began
fancying
the
sort
of
thing
that
would
happen:
‘“Miss
!
Come
here
directly,
and
get
ready
for
your
walk!”
Coming
in
a
minute,
nurse!
But
I’ve
t
to
see
that
the
mouse
doesn’t
t
out.”
y
I
don’t
hink,’
ce
went
on,
‘that
ey’d
t
Dinah
stop
in
the
house
if
it
began
ordering
people
about
like
that!’
By
this
time
she
had
found
her
way
into
a
tidy
little
room
with
a
table
in
the
window,
and
on
it
(as
she
had
hoped)
a
fan
and
two
or
three
pairs
of
tiny
white
kid
gloves:
she
took
up
the
fan
and
a
pair
of
the
gloves,
and
was
just
going
to
leave
the
room,
when
her
eye
fell
upon
a
little
bottle
that
stood
near
the
looking-glass.
here
was
no
label
this
time
with
the
words
‘DRINK
,’
nevertheless
she
uncorked
it
and
put
it
to
her
lips.
‘I
ow
SOMETHING
interesting
is
sure
to
happen,’
said
to
herself,
‘whenever
eat
or
drink
anything;
so
I’ll
st
see
what
this
bottle
does.
I
do
hope
it’ll
ke
me
grow
large
again,
for
really
I’m
ite
tired
of
being
such
a
tiny
little
thing!’
It
did
so
indeed,
and
much
sooner
than
she
had
expected:
before
she
had
drunk
half
the
bottle,
she
found
her
head
pressing
against
the
ceiling,
and
had
to
stoop
to
save
her
neck
from
being
broken.
She
hastily
put
down
the
bottle,
saying
to
herself
‘That’s
enough--I
ope
I
shan’t
row
any
more--As
t
is,
I
can’t
t
out
at
the
door--I
o
wish
I
hadn’t
runk
quite
so
much!’
Alas!
it
was
too
late
to
wish
that!
She
went
on
growing,
and
growing,
and
very
soon
had
to
kneel
down
on
the
floor:
in
another
minute
there
was
not
even
room
for
this,
and
she
tried
the
effect
of
lying
down
with
one
elbow
against
the
door,
and
the
other
arm
curled
round
her
head.
Still
she
went
on
growing,
and,
as
a
last
resource,
she
put
one
arm
out
of
the
window,
and
one
foot
up
the
chimney,
and
said
to
herself
‘Now
can
do
no
more,
whatever
happens.
What
WILL
become
of
me?’
Luckily
for
Alice,
the
little
magic
bottle
had
now
had
its
full
effect,
and
she
grew
no
larger:
still
it
was
very
uncomfortable,
and,
as
there
seemed
to
be
no
sort
of
chance
of
her
ever
getting
out
of
the
room
again,
no
wonder
she
felt
unhappy.
‘It
s
much
pleasanter
at
home,’
ught
poor
Alice,
‘when
e
wasn’t
lways
growing
larger
and
smaller,
and
being
ordered
about
by
mice
and
rabbits.
I
almost
wish
I
hadn’t
ne
down
that
rabbit-hole--and
t--and
yet--it’s
er
curious,
you
know,
this
sort
of
life!
I
do
wonder
what
CAN
have
happened
to
me!
When
I
used
to
read
fairy-tales,
fancied
that
kind
of
thing
never
happened,
and
now
here
I
am
in
the
middle
of
one!
There
ought
to
be
a
book
written
about
me,
that
there
ought!
And
when
I
grow
up,
I’ll
ite
one--but
’m
own
up
now,’
added
in
a
sorrowful
tone;
‘at
ast
there’s
room
to
grow
up
any
more
HERE.’
‘But
en,’
ught
Alice,
‘shall
NEVER
get
any
older
than
I
am
now?
That’ll
a
comfort,
one
way--never
o
be
an
old
woman--but
then--always
o
have
lessons
to
learn!
Oh,
I
shouldn’t
ke
THAT!’
‘Oh,
foolish
Alice!’
answered
herself.
‘How
n
you
learn
lessons
in
here?
Why,
there’s
rdly
room
for
YOU,
and
no
room
at
all
for
any
lesson-books!’
nd
so
she
went
on,
taking
first
one
side
and
then
the
other,
and
making
quite
a
conversation
of
it
altogether;
but
after
a
few
minutes
she
heard
a
voice
outside,
and
stopped
to
listen.
‘Mary
n!
Mary
Ann!’
d
the
voice.
‘Fetch
my
gloves
this
moment!’
en
came
a
little
pattering
of
feet
on
the
stairs.
Alice
knew
it
was
the
Rabbit
coming
to
look
for
her,
and
she
trembled
till
she
shook
the
house,
quite
forgetting
that
she
was
now
about
a
thousand
times
as
large
as
the
Rabbit,
and
had
no
reason
to
be
afraid
of
it.
Presently
the
Rabbit
came
up
to
the
door,
and
tried
to
open
it;
but,
as
the
door
opened
inwards,
and
Alice’s
bow
was
pressed
hard
against
it,
that
attempt
proved
a
failure.
Alice
heard
it
say
to
itself
‘Then
ll
go
round
and
get
in
at
the
window.’
‘THAT
u
won’t’
ht
Alice,
and,
after
waiting
till
she
fancied
she
heard
the
Rabbit
just
under
the
window,
she
suddenly
spread
out
her
hand,
and
made
a
snatch
in
the
air.
She
did
not
get
hold
of
anything,
but
she
heard
a
little
shriek
and
a
fall,
and
a
crash
of
broken
glass,
from
which
she
concluded
that
it
was
just
possible
it
had
fallen
into
a
cucumber-frame,
r
something
of
the
sort.
Next
came
an
angry
voice--the
abbit’s--‘Pat!
re
are
you?’
then
a
voice
she
had
never
heard
before,
‘Sure
en
I’m
re!
Digging
for
apples,
yer
honour!’
‘Digging
r
apples,
indeed!’
d
the
Rabbit
angrily.
‘Here!
e
and
help
me
out
of
THIS!’
unds
of
more
broken
glass.)
‘Now
ll
me,
Pat,
what’s
at
in
the
window?’
‘Sure,
s
n
arm,
yer
honour!’
pronounced
it
‘arrum.’)
n
arm,
you
goose!
Who
ever
saw
one
that
size?
Why,
it
fills
the
whole
window!’
‘Sure,
does,
yer
honour:
but
it’s
arm
for
all
that.’
‘Well,
s
ot
no
business
there,
at
any
rate:
go
and
take
it
away!’
There
was
a
long
silence
after
this,
and
Alice
could
only
hear
whispers
now
and
then;
such
as,
‘Sure,
on’t
ke
it,
yer
honour,
at
all,
at
all!’
Do
as
I
tell
you,
you
coward!’
at
last
she
spread
out
her
hand
again,
and
made
another
snatch
in
the
air.
This
time
there
were
TWO
little
shrieks,
and
more
sounds
of
broken
glass.
‘What
number
of
cucumber-frames
there
must
be!’
ught
Alice.
‘I
nder
what
they’ll
next!
As
for
pulling
me
out
of
the
window,
I
only
wish
they
COULD!
I’m
ure
I
don’t
nt
to
stay
in
here
any
longer!’
She
waited
for
some
time
without
hearing
anything
more:
at
last
came
a
rumbling
of
little
cartwheels,
and
the
sound
of
a
good
many
voices
all
talking
together:
she
made
out
the
words:
‘Where’s
ther
ladder?--Why,
adn’t
bring
but

Bill’s
t
the

‘Oh!

chimney,

d
Alice
to
herself.
‘Shy,
y
seem
to
put
everything
upon
Bill!
I
wouldn’t
in
Bill’s
ace
for
a
good
deal:
this
fireplace
is
narrow,
to
be
sure;
but
I
THINK
I
can
kick
a
little!’
She
drew
her
foot
as
far
down
the
chimney
as
she
could,
and
waited
till
she
heard
a
little
animal
(she
couldn’t
ess
of
what
sort
it
was)
scratching
and
scrambling
about
in
the
chimney
close
above
her:
then,
saying
to
herself
‘This
Bill,’
gave
one
sharp
kick,
and
waited
to
see
what
would
happen
next.
The
first
thing
she
heard
was
a
general
chorus
of
‘There
es
Bill!’
en
the
Rabbit’s
ice
along--‘Catch
you
by
the
hedge!’
n
silence,
and
then
another
confusion
of
voices--‘Hold
is
head--Brandy
now--Don’t
e
him--How
as
it,
old
fellow?
What
happened
to
you?
Tell
us
all
about
it!’
Last
came
a
little
feeble,
squeaking
voice,
[‘That’s

hought
Alice,)
Well,
hardly
know--No
ore,
thank
ye;
I’m
tter
now--but
’m
deal
too
flustered
to
tell
you--all
know
is,
something
comes
at
me
like
a
Jack-in-the-box,
up
I
goes
like
a
sky-rocket!’
So
ou
did,
old
fellow!’
d
the
others.
‘We
st
burn
the
house
down!’
d
the
Rabbit’s
ice;
and
Alice
called
out
as
loud
as
she
could,
‘If
u
do.
I’ll
t
Dinah
at
you!’
There
was
a
dead
silence
instantly,
and
Alice
thought
to
herself,
‘I
onder
what
they
WILL
do
next!
If
they
had
any
sense,
they’d
ke
the
roof
off.’
er
a
minute
or
two,
they
began
moving
about
again,
and
Alice
heard
the
Rabbit
say,
‘A
rrowful
will
do,
to
begin
with.’
‘A
rrowful
of
WHAT?’
ught
Alice;
but
she
had
not
long
to
doubt,
for
the
next
moment
a
shower
of
little
pebbles
came
rattling
in
at
the
window,
and
some
of
them
hit
her
in
the
face.
‘I’ll
stop
to
this,’
e
said
to
herself,
and
shouted
out,
‘You’d
r
not
do
that
again!’
ich
produced
another
dead
silence.
Alice
noticed
with
some
surprise
that
the
pebbles
were
all
turning
into
little
cakes
as
they
lay
on
the
floor,
and
a
bright
idea
came
into
her
head.
‘If
eat
one
of
these
cakes,’
thought,
‘it’s
to
make
SOME
change
in
my
size;
and
as
it
can’t
ssibly
make
me
larger,
it
must
make
me
smaller,
I
suppose.’
So
she
swallowed
one
of
the
cakes,
and
was
delighted
to
find
that
she
began
shrinking
directly.
As
soon
as
she
was
small
enough
to
get
through
the
door,
she
ran
out
of
the
house,
and
found
quite
a
crowd
of
little
animals
and
birds
waiting
outside.
The
poor
little
Lizard,
Bill,
was
in
the
middle,
being
held
up
by
two
guinea-pigs,
ho
were
giving
it
something
out
of
a
bottle.
They
all
made
a
rush
at
Alice
the
moment
she
appeared;
but
she
ran
off
as
hard
as
she
could,
and
soon
found
herself
safe
in
a
thick
wood.
‘The
rst
thing
I’ve
t
to
do,’
d
Alice
to
herself,
as
she
wandered
about
in
the
wood,
‘is
grow
to
my
right
size
again;
and
the
second
thing
is
to
find
my
way
into
that
lovely
garden.
I
think
that
will
be
the
best
plan.’
It
sounded
an
excellent
plan,
no
doubt,
and
very
neatly
and
simply
arranged;
the
only
difficulty
was,
that
she
had
not
the
smallest
idea
how
to
set
about
it;
and
while
she
was
peering
about
anxiously
among
the
trees,
a
little
sharp
bark
just
over
her
head
made
her
look
up
in
a
great
hurry.
An
enormous
puppy
was
looking
down
at
her
with
large
round
eyes,
and
feebly
stretching
out
one
paw,
trying
to
touch
her.
‘Poor
ttle
thing!’
id
Alice,
in
a
coaxing
tone,
and
she
tried
hard
to
whistle
to
it;
but
she
was
terribly
frightened
all
the
time
at
the
thought
that
it
might
be
hungry,
in
which
case
it
would
be
very
likely
to
eat
her
up
in
spite
of
all
her
coaxing.
Hardly
knowing
what
she
did,
she
picked
up
a
little
bit
of
stick,
and
held
it
out
to
the
puppy;
whereupon
the
puppy
jumped
into
the
air
off
all
its
feet
at
once,
with
a
yelp
of
delight,
and
rushed
at
the
stick,
and
made
believe
to
worry
it;
then
Alice
dodged
behind
a
great
thistle,
to
keep
herself
from
being
run
over;
and
the
moment
she
appeared
on
the
other
side,
the
puppy
made
another
rush
at
the
stick,
and
tumbled
head
over
heels
in
its
hurry
to
get
hold
of
it;
then
Alice,
thinking
it
was
very
like
having
a
game
of
play
with
a
cart-horse,
nd
expecting
every
moment
to
be
trampled
under
its
feet,
ran
round
the
thistle
again;
then
the
puppy
began
a
series
of
short
charges
at
the
stick,
running
a
very
little
way
forwards
each
time
and
a
long
way
back,
and
barking
hoarsely
all
the
while,
till
at
last
it
sat
down
a
good
way
off,
panting,
with
its
tongue
hanging
out
of
its
mouth,
and
its
great
eyes
half
shut.
This
seemed
to
Alice
a
good
opportunity
for
making
her
escape;
so
she
set
off
at
once,
and
ran
till
she
was
quite
tired
and
out
of
breath,
and
till
the
puppy’s
rk
sounded
quite
faint
in
the
distance.
‘And
t
what
a
dear
little
puppy
it
was!’
d
Alice,
as
she
leant
against
a
buttercup
to
rest
herself,
and
fanned
herself
with
one
of
the
leaves:
‘I
ould
have
liked
teaching
it
tricks
very
much,
if--if
’d
nly
been
the
right
size
to
do
it!
Oh
dear!
I’d
arly
forgotten
that
I’ve
t
to
grow
up
again!
Let
me
see--how
S
it
to
be
managed?
I
suppose
I
ought
to
eat
or
drink
something
or
other;
but
the
great
question
is,
what?’
The
great
question
certainly
was,
what?
Alice
looked
all
round
her
at
the
flowers
and
the
blades
of
grass,
but
she
did
not
see
anything
that
looked
like
the
right
thing
to
eat
or
drink
under
the
circumstances.
There
was
a
large
mushroom
growing
near
her,
about
the
same
height
as
herself;
and
when
she
had
looked
under
it,
and
on
both
sides
of
it,
and
behind
it,
it
occurred
to
her
that
she
might
as
well
look
and
see
what
was
on
the
top
of
it.
She
stretched
herself
up
on
tiptoe,
and
peeped
over
the
edge
of
the
mushroom,
and
her
eyes
immediately
met
those
of
a
large
caterpillar,
that
was
sitting
on
the
top
with
its
arms
folded,
quietly
smoking
a
long
hookah,
and
taking
not
the
smallest
notice
of
her
or
of
anything
else.
CHAPTER
V.
Advice
from
a
Caterpillar
The
Caterpillar
and
Alice
looked
at
each
other
for
some
time
in
silence:
at
last
the
Caterpillar
took
the
hookah
out
of
its
mouth,
and
addressed
her
in
a
languid,
sleepy
voice.
‘Who
e
YOU?’
d
the
Caterpillar.
This
was
not
an
encouraging
opening
for
a
conversation.
Alice
replied,
rather
shyly,
‘I--I
ly
know,
sir,
just
at
present--at
east
I
know
who
I
WAS
when
I
got
up
this
morning,
but
I
think
I
must
have
been
changed
several
times
since
then.’
‘What
you
mean
by
that?’
d
the
Caterpillar
sternly.
‘Explain
ourself!’
‘I
n’t
plain
MYSELF,
I’m
raid,
sir’
id
Alice,
‘because
m
ot
myself,
you
see.’
‘I
n’t
e,’
d
the
Caterpillar.
‘I’m
d
I
can’t
t
it
more
clearly,’
ce
replied
very
politely,
‘for
can’t
derstand
it
myself
to
begin
with;
and
being
so
many
different
sizes
in
a
day
is
very
confusing.’
‘It
n’t,’
he
Caterpillar.
‘Well,
haps
you
haven’t
und
it
so
yet,’
d
Alice;
‘but
en
you
have
to
turn
into
a
chrysalis--you
ill
some
day,
you
know--and
hen
after
that
into
a
butterfly,
I
should
think
you’ll
el
it
a
little
queer,
won’t
u?’
‘Not
bit,’
d
the
Caterpillar.
‘Well,
haps
your
feelings
may
be
different,’
d
Alice;
‘all
know
is,
it
would
feel
very
queer
to
ME.’
‘You!’
he
Caterpillar
contemptuously.
‘Who
e
YOU?’
Which
brought
them
back
again
to
the
beginning
of
the
conversation.
Alice
felt
a
little
irritated
at
the
Caterpillar’s
king
such
VERY
short
remarks,
and
she
drew
herself
up
and
said,
very
gravely,
‘I
ink,
you
ought
to
tell
me
who
YOU
are,
first.’
‘Why?’
he
Caterpillar.
Here
was
another
puzzling
question;
and
as
Alice
could
not
think
of
any
good
reason,
and
as
the
Caterpillar
seemed
to
be
in
a
VERY
unpleasant
state
of
mind,
she
turned
away.
‘Come
ck!’
Caterpillar
called
after
her.
‘I’ve
hing
important
to
say!’
This
sounded
promising,
certainly:
Alice
turned
and
came
back
again.
‘Keep
ur
temper,’
d
the
Caterpillar.
‘Is
at
all?’
d
Alice,
swallowing
down
her
anger
as
well
as
she
could.
‘No,’
he
Caterpillar.
Alice
thought
she
might
as
well
wait,
as
she
had
nothing
else
to
do,
and
perhaps
after
all
it
might
tell
her
something
worth
hearing.
For
some
minutes
it
puffed
away
without
speaking,
but
at
last
it
unfolded
its
arms,
took
the
hookah
out
of
its
mouth
again,
and
said,
‘So
u
think
you’re
anged,
do
you?’
‘I’m
d
I
am,
sir,’
d
Alice;
‘I
n’t
member
things
as
I
used--and
don’t
ep
the
same
size
for
ten
minutes
together!’
‘Can’t
ber
WHAT
things?’
d
the
Caterpillar.
‘Well,
ve
tried
to
say
“HOW
TH
THE
LITTLE
BUSY
BEE,”
it
all
came
different!’
ce
replied
in
a
very
melancholy
voice.
‘Repeat,
YOU
ARE
OLD,
FATHER
WILLIAM,”’
he
Caterpillar.
Alice
folded
her
hands,
and
began:--
‘You
e
old,
Father
William,’
young
man
said,
‘And
ur
hair
has
become
very
white;
And
yet
you
incessantly
stand
on
your
head--
Do
you
think,
at
your
age,
it
is
right?’
‘In
youth,’
her
William
replied
to
his
son,
‘I
ared
it
might
injure
the
brain;
But,
now
that
I’m
rfectly
sure
I
have
none,
Why,
I
do
it
again
and
again.’
‘You
e
old,’
d
the
youth,
‘as
mentioned
before,
And
have
grown
most
uncommonly
fat;
Yet
you
turned
a
back-somersault
in
at
the
door--
Pray,
what
is
the
reason
of
that?’
‘In
youth,’
d
the
sage,
as
he
shook
his
grey
locks,
‘I
pt
all
my
limbs
very
supple
By
the
use
of
this
ointment--one
hilling
the
box--
Allow
me
to
sell
you
a
couple?’
‘You
e
old,’
d
the
youth,
‘and
ur
jaws
are
too
weak
For
anything
tougher
than
suet;
Yet
you
finished
the
goose,
with
the
bones
and
the
beak--
Pray
how
did
you
manage
to
do
it?’
‘In
youth,’
d
his
father,
‘I
ok
to
the
law,
And
argued
each
case
with
my
wife;
And
the
muscular
strength,
which
it
gave
to
my
jaw,
Has
lasted
the
rest
of
my
life.’
‘You
e
old,’
d
the
youth,
‘one
uld
hardly
suppose
That
your
eye
was
as
steady
as
ever;
Yet
you
balanced
an
eel
on
the
end
of
your
nose--
What
made
you
so
awfully
clever?’
‘I
ve
answered
three
questions,
and
that
is
enough,’
Said
his
father;
‘don’t
yourself
airs!
Do
you
think
I
can
listen
all
day
to
such
stuff?
Be
off,
or
I’ll
ck
you
down
stairs!’
‘That
not
said
right,’
d
the
Caterpillar.
‘Not
ITE
right,
I’m
raid,’
d
Alice,
timidly;
‘some
the
words
have
got
altered.’
‘It
wrong
from
beginning
to
end,’
d
the
Caterpillar
decidedly,
and
there
was
silence
for
some
minutes.
The
Caterpillar
was
the
first
to
speak.
‘What
ze
do
you
want
to
be?’
asked.
‘Oh,
m
not
particular
as
to
size,’
ce
hastily
replied;
‘only
e
doesn’t
ke
changing
so
often,
you
know.’
‘I
N’T
ow,’
d
the
Caterpillar.
Alice
said
nothing:
she
had
never
been
so
much
contradicted
in
her
life
before,
and
she
felt
that
she
was
losing
her
temper.
‘Are
u
content
now?’
d
the
Caterpillar.
‘Well,
hould
like
to
be
a
LITTLE
larger,
sir,
if
you
wouldn’t
nd,’
id
Alice:
‘three
ches
is
such
a
wretched
height
to
be.’
‘It
a
very
good
height
indeed!’
d
the
Caterpillar
angrily,
rearing
itself
upright
as
it
spoke
(it
was
exactly
three
inches
high).
‘But
m
ot
used
to
it!’
aded
poor
Alice
in
a
piteous
tone.
And
she
thought
of
herself,
‘I
sh
the
creatures
wouldn’t
so
easily
offended!’
‘You’ll
sed
to
it
in
time,’
d
the
Caterpillar;
and
it
put
the
hookah
into
its
mouth
and
began
smoking
again.
This
time
Alice
waited
patiently
until
it
chose
to
speak
again.
In
a
minute
or
two
the
Caterpillar
took
the
hookah
out
of
its
mouth
and
yawned
once
or
twice,
and
shook
itself.
Then
it
got
down
off
the
mushroom,
and
crawled
away
in
the
grass,
merely
remarking
as
it
went,
‘One
de
will
make
you
grow
taller,
and
the
other
side
will
make
you
grow
shorter.’
‘One
de
of
WHAT?
The
other
side
of
WHAT?’
ught
Alice
to
herself.
‘Of
e
mushroom,’
d
the
Caterpillar,
just
as
if
she
had
asked
it
aloud;
and
in
another
moment
it
was
out
of
sight.
Alice
remained
looking
thoughtfully
at
the
mushroom
for
a
minute,
trying
to
make
out
which
were
the
two
sides
of
it;
and
as
it
was
perfectly
round,
she
found
this
a
very
difficult
question.
However,
at
last
she
stretched
her
arms
round
it
as
far
as
they
would
go,
and
broke
off
a
bit
of
the
edge
with
each
hand.
‘And
w
which
is
which?’
said
to
herself,
and
nibbled
a
little
of
the
right-hand
bit
to
try
the
effect:
the
next
moment
she
felt
a
violent
blow
underneath
her
chin:
it
had
struck
her
foot!
She
was
a
good
deal
frightened
by
this
very
sudden
change,
but
she
felt
that
there
was
no
time
to
be
lost,
as
she
was
shrinking
rapidly;
so
she
set
to
work
at
once
to
eat
some
of
the
other
bit.
Her
chin
was
pressed
so
closely
against
her
foot,
that
there
was
hardly
room
to
open
her
mouth;
but
she
did
it
at
last,
and
managed
to
swallow
a
morsel
of
the
lefthand
bit.

‘Come,
head’s
ee
at
last!’
d
Alice
in
a
tone
of
delight,
which
changed
into
alarm
in
another
moment,
when
she
found
that
her
shoulders
were
nowhere
to
be
found:
all
she
could
see,
when
she
looked
down,
was
an
immense
length
of
neck,
which
seemed
to
rise
like
a
stalk
out
of
a
sea
of
green
leaves
that
lay
far
below
her.
‘What
N
all
that
green
stuff
be?’
d
Alice.
‘And
ere
HAVE
my
shoulders
got
to?
And
oh,
my
poor
hands,
how
is
it
I
can’t
e
you?’
e
was
moving
them
about
as
she
spoke,
but
no
result
seemed
to
follow,
except
a
little
shaking
among
the
distant
green
leaves.
As
there
seemed
to
be
no
chance
of
getting
her
hands
up
to
her
head,
she
tried
to
get
her
head
down
to
them,
and
was
delighted
to
find
that
her
neck
would
bend
about
easily
in
any
direction,
like
a
serpent.
She
had
just
succeeded
in
curving
it
down
into
a
graceful
zigzag,
and
was
going
to
dive
in
among
the
leaves,
which
she
found
to
be
nothing
but
the
tops
of
the
trees
under
which
she
had
been
wandering,
when
a
sharp
hiss
made
her
draw
back
in
a
hurry:
a
large
pigeon
had
flown
into
her
face,
and
was
beating
her
violently
with
its
wings.
‘Serpent!’
ed
the
Pigeon.
‘I’m
serpent!’
d
Alice
indignantly.
‘Let
alone!’
‘Serpent,
ay
again!’
eated
the
Pigeon,
but
in
a
more
subdued
tone,
and
added
with
a
kind
of
sob,
‘I’ve
every
way,
and
nothing
seems
to
suit
them!’
‘I
ven’t
e
least
idea
what
you’re
lking
about,’
d
Alice.
‘I’ve
the
roots
of
trees,
and
I’ve
ied
banks,
and
I’ve
ied
hedges,’
Pigeon
went
on,
without
attending
to
her;
‘but
ose
serpents!
There’s
pleasing
them!’
Alice
was
more
and
more
puzzled,
but
she
thought
there
was
no
use
in
saying
anything
more
till
the
Pigeon
had
finished.
‘As
it
wasn’t
ouble
enough
hatching
the
eggs,’
d
the
Pigeon;
‘but
must
be
on
the
look-out
for
serpents
night
and
day!
Why,
I
haven’t
d
a
wink
of
sleep
these
three
weeks!’
‘I’m
sorry
you’ve
en
annoyed,’
d
Alice,
who
was
beginning
to
see
its
meaning.
‘And
st
as
I’d
ken
the
highest
tree
in
the
wood,’
tinued
the
Pigeon,
raising
its
voice
to
a
shriek,
‘and
st
as
I
was
thinking
I
should
be
free
of
them
at
last,
they
must
needs
come
wriggling
down
from
the
sky!
Ugh,
Serpent!’
‘But
m
OT
a
serpent,
I
tell
you!’
d
Alice.
‘I’m
m
--’
Well!
AT
are
you?’
d
the
Pigeon.
‘I
n
see
you’re
ying
to
invent
something!’
‘I--I’m
e
girl,’
d
Alice,
rather
doubtfully,
as
she
remembered
the
number
of
changes
she
had
gone
through
that
day.
‘A
kely
story
indeed!’
d
the
Pigeon
in
a
tone
of
the
deepest
contempt.
‘I’ve
a
good
many
little
girls
in
my
time,
but
never
ONE
with
such
a
neck
as
that!
No,
no!
You’re
serpent;
and
there’s
use
denying
it.
I
suppose
you’ll
telling
me
next
that
you
never
tasted
an
egg!’
‘I
VE
tasted
eggs,
certainly,’
d
Alice,
who
was
a
very
truthful
child;
‘but
ttle
girls
eat
eggs
quite
as
much
as
serpents
do,
you
know.’
‘I
n’t
lieve
it,’
d
the
Pigeon;
‘but
they
do,
why
then
they’re
kind
of
serpent,
that’s
l
I
can
say.’
This
was
such
a
new
idea
to
Alice,
that
she
was
quite
silent
for
a
minute
or
two,
which
gave
the
Pigeon
the
opportunity
of
adding,
‘You’re
ing
for
eggs,
I
know
THAT
well
enough;
and
what
does
it
matter
to
me
whether
you’re
little
girl
or
a
serpent?’
‘It
tters
a
good
deal
to
ME,’
d
Alice
hastily;
‘but
m
ot
looking
for
eggs,
as
it
happens;
and
if
I
was,
I
shouldn’t
nt
YOURS:
I
don’t
ike
them
raw.’
‘Well,
off,
then!’
d
the
Pigeon
in
a
sulky
tone,
as
it
settled
down
again
into
its
nest.
Alice
crouched
down
among
the
trees
as
well
as
she
could,
for
her
neck
kept
getting
entangled
among
the
branches,
and
every
now
and
then
she
had
to
stop
and
untwist
it.
After
a
while
she
remembered
that
she
still
held
the
pieces
of
mushroom
in
her
hands,
and
she
set
to
work
very
carefully,
nibbling
first
at
one
and
then
at
the
other,
and
growing
sometimes
taller
and
sometimes
shorter,
until
she
had
succeeded
in
bringing
herself
down
to
her
usual
height.
It
was
so
long
since
she
had
been
anything
near
the
right
size,
that
it
felt
quite
strange
at
first;
but
she
got
used
to
it
in
a
few
minutes,
and
began
talking
to
herself,
as
usual.
‘Come,
re’s
lf
my
plan
done
now!
How
puzzling
all
these
changes
are!
I’m
ver
sure
what
I’m
ing
to
be,
from
one
minute
to
another!
However,
I’ve
t
back
to
my
right
size:
the
next
thing
is,
to
get
into
that
beautiful
garden--how
S
that
to
be
done,
I
wonder?’
she
said
this,
she
came
suddenly
upon
an
open
place,
with
a
little
house
in
it
about
four
feet
high.
‘Whoever
ves
there,’
ught
Alice,
‘it’ll
do
to
come
upon
them
THIS
size:
why,
I
should
frighten
them
out
of
their
wits!’
she
began
nibbling
at
the
righthand
bit
again,
and
did
not
venture
to
go
near
the
house
till
she
had
brought
herself
down
to
nine
inches
high.
CHAPTER
VI.
Pig
and
Pepper
For
a
minute
or
two
she
stood
looking
at
the
house,
and
wondering
what
to
do
next,
when
suddenly
a
footman
in
livery
came
running
out
of
the
wood--(she
nsidered
him
to
be
a
footman
because
he
was
in
livery:
otherwise,
judging
by
his
face
only,
she
would
have
called
him
a
fish)--and
pped
loudly
at
the
door
with
his
knuckles.
It
was
opened
by
another
footman
in
livery,
with
a
round
face,
and
large
eyes
like
a
frog;
and
both
footmen,
Alice
noticed,
had
powdered
hair
that
curled
all
over
their
heads.
She
felt
very
curious
to
know
what
it
was
all
about,
and
crept
a
little
way
out
of
the
wood
to
listen.
The
Fish-Footman
began
by
producing
from
under
his
arm
a
great
letter,
nearly
as
large
as
himself,
and
this
he
handed
over
to
the
other,
saying,
in
a
solemn
tone,
‘For
e
Duchess.
An
invitation
from
the
Queen
to
play
croquet.’
Frog-Footman
repeated,
in
the
same
solemn
tone,
only
changing
the
order
of
the
words
a
little,
‘From
e
Queen.
An
invitation
for
the
Duchess
to
play
croquet.’
Then
they
both
bowed
low,
and
their
curls
got
entangled
together.
Alice
laughed
so
much
at
this,
that
she
had
to
run
back
into
the
wood
for
fear
of
their
hearing
her;
and
when
she
next
peeped
out
the
Fish-Footman
was
gone,
and
the
other
was
sitting
on
the
ground
near
the
door,
staring
stupidly
up
into
the
sky.
Alice
went
timidly
up
to
the
door,
and
knocked.
‘There’s
rt
of
use
in
knocking,’
d
the
Footman,
‘and
at
for
two
reasons.
First,
because
I’m
the
same
side
of
the
door
as
you
are;
secondly,
because
they’re
king
such
a
noise
inside,
no
one
could
possibly
hear
you.’
certainly
there
was
a
most
extraordinary
noise
going
on
within--a
onstant
howling
and
sneezing,
and
every
now
and
then
a
great
crash,
as
if
a
dish
or
kettle
had
been
broken
to
pieces.
‘Please,
n,’
d
Alice,
‘how
I
to
get
in?’
‘There
ght
be
some
sense
in
your
knocking,’
Footman
went
on
without
attending
to
her,
‘if
had
the
door
between
us.
For
instance,
if
you
were
INSIDE,
you
might
knock,
and
I
could
let
you
out,
you
know.’
was
looking
up
into
the
sky
all
the
time
he
was
speaking,
and
this
Alice
thought
decidedly
uncivil.
‘But
rhaps
he
can’t
lp
it,’
said
to
herself;
‘his
es
are
so
VERY
nearly
at
the
top
of
his
head.
But
at
any
rate
he
might
answer
questions.--How
I
to
get
in?’
repeated,
aloud.
‘I
all
sit
here,’
Footman
remarked,
‘till
morrow--’
t
this
moment
the
door
of
the
house
opened,
and
a
large
plate
came
skimming
out,
straight
at
the
Footman’s
ad:
it
just
grazed
his
nose,
and
broke
to
pieces
against
one
of
the
trees
behind
him.
‘--or
day,
maybe,’
Footman
continued
in
the
same
tone,
exactly
as
if
nothing
had
happened.
‘How
I
to
get
in?’
ed
Alice
again,
in
a
louder
tone.
‘ARE
u
to
get
in
at
all?’
d
the
Footman.
‘That’s
irst
question,
you
know.’
It
was,
no
doubt:
only
Alice
did
not
like
to
be
told
so.
‘It’s
y
dreadful,’
muttered
to
herself,
‘the
y
all
the
creatures
argue.
It’s
ough
to
drive
one
crazy!’
The
Footman
seemed
to
think
this
a
good
opportunity
for
repeating
his
remark,
with
variations.
‘I
all
sit
here,’
said,
‘on
d
off,
for
days
and
days.’
‘But
at
am
I
to
do?’
d
Alice.
‘Anything
u
like,’
d
the
Footman,
and
began
whistling.
‘Oh,
re’s
use
in
talking
to
him,’
d
Alice
desperately:
‘he’s
ectly
idiotic!’
she
opened
the
door
and
went
in.
The
door
led
right
into
a
large
kitchen,
which
was
full
of
smoke
from
one
end
to
the
other:
the
Duchess
was
sitting
on
a
three-legged
stool
in
the
middle,
nursing
a
baby;
the
cook
was
leaning
over
the
fire,
stirring
a
large
cauldron
which
seemed
to
be
full
of
soup.
‘There’s
inly
too
much
pepper
in
that
soup!’
ce
said
to
herself,
as
well
as
she
could
for
sneezing.
There
was
certainly
too
much
of
it
in
the
air.
Even
the
Duchess
sneezed
occasionally;
and
as
for
the
baby,
it
was
sneezing
and
howling
alternately
without
a
moment’s
use.
The
only
things
in
the
kitchen
that
did
not
sneeze,
were
the
cook,
and
a
large
cat
which
was
sitting
on
the
hearth
and
grinning
from
ear
to
ear.
‘Please
uld
you
tell
me,’
d
Alice,
a
little
timidly,
for
she
was
not
quite
sure
whether
it
was
good
manners
for
her
to
speak
first,
‘why
our
cat
grins
like
that?’
‘It’s
shire
cat,’
d
the
Duchess,
‘and
at’s
y.
Pig!’
She
said
the
last
word
with
such
sudden
violence
that
Alice
quite
jumped;
but
she
saw
in
another
moment
that
it
was
addressed
to
the
baby,
and
not
to
her,
so
she
took
courage,
and
went
on
again:--
‘I
dn’t
ow
that
Cheshire
cats
always
grinned;
in
fact,
I
didn’t
ow
that
cats
COULD
grin.’
‘They
l
can,’
d
the
Duchess;
‘and
st
of
‘em
.’
‘I
n’t
ow
of
any
that
do,’
ce
said
very
politely,
feeling
quite
pleased
to
have
got
into
a
conversation.
‘You
n’t
ow
much,’
d
the
Duchess;
‘and
at’s
fact.’
Alice
did
not
at
all
like
the
tone
of
this
remark,
and
thought
it
would
be
as
well
to
introduce
some
other
subject
of
conversation.
While
she
was
trying
to
fix
on
one,
the
cook
took
the
cauldron
of
soup
off
the
fire,
and
at
once
set
to
work
throwing
everything
within
her
reach
at
the
Duchess
and
the
baby--the
ire-irons
came
first;
then
followed
a
shower
of
saucepans,
plates,
and
dishes.
The
Duchess
took
no
notice
of
them
even
when
they
hit
her;
and
the
baby
was
howling
so
much
already,
that
it
was
quite
impossible
to
say
whether
the
blows
hurt
it
or
not.
‘Oh,
ASE
mind
what
you’re
ing!’
ed
Alice,
jumping
up
and
down
in
an
agony
of
terror.
‘Oh,
re
goes
his
PRECIOUS
nose’;
an
unusually
large
saucepan
flew
close
by
it,
and
very
nearly
carried
it
off.
‘If
erybody
minded
their
own
business,’
Duchess
said
in
a
hoarse
growl,
‘the
rld
would
go
round
a
deal
faster
than
it
does.’
‘Which
uld
NOT
be
an
advantage,’
d
Alice,
who
felt
very
glad
to
get
an
opportunity
of
showing
off
a
little
of
her
knowledge.
‘Just
ink
of
what
work
it
would
make
with
the
day
and
night!
You
see
the
earth
takes
twenty-four
hours
to
turn
round
on
its
axis--’
Talking
f
axes,’
d
the
Duchess,
‘chop
f
her
head!’
Alice
glanced
rather
anxiously
at
the
cook,
to
see
if
she
meant
to
take
the
hint;
but
the
cook
was
busily
stirring
the
soup,
and
seemed
not
to
be
listening,
so
she
went
on
again:
‘Twenty-four
rs,
I
THINK;
or
is
it
twelve?
I--’
Oh,
n’t
ther
ME,’
d
the
Duchess;
‘I
ver
could
abide
figures!’
d
with
that
she
began
nursing
her
child
again,
singing
a
sort
of
lullaby
to
it
as
she
did
so,
and
giving
it
a
violent
shake
at
the
end
of
every
line:
‘Speak
ughly
to
your
little
boy,
And
beat
him
when
he
sneezes:
He
only
does
it
to
annoy,
Because
he
knows
it
teases.’
CHORUS.
(In
which
the
cook
and
the
baby
joined):--
‘Wow!
!
wow!’
While
the
Duchess
sang
the
second
verse
of
the
song,
she
kept
tossing
the
baby
violently
up
and
down,
and
the
poor
little
thing
howled
so,
that
Alice
could
hardly
hear
the
words:--
‘I
eak
severely
to
my
boy,
I
beat
him
when
he
sneezes;
For
he
can
thoroughly
enjoy
The
pepper
when
he
pleases!’
CHORUS.
‘Wow!
!
wow!’
‘Here!
may
nurse
it
a
bit,
if
you
like!’
Duchess
said
to
Alice,
flinging
the
baby
at
her
as
she
spoke.
‘I
st
go
and
get
ready
to
play
croquet
with
the
Queen,’
she
hurried
out
of
the
room.
The
cook
threw
a
frying-pan
after
her
as
she
went
out,
but
it
just
missed
her.
Alice
caught
the
baby
with
some
difficulty,
as
it
was
a
queer-shaped
little
creature,
and
held
out
its
arms
and
legs
in
all
directions,
‘just
ike
a
star-fish,’
ght
Alice.
The
poor
little
thing
was
snorting
like
a
steam-engine
when
she
caught
it,
and
kept
doubling
itself
up
and
straightening
itself
out
again,
so
that
altogether,
for
the
first
minute
or
two,
it
was
as
much
as
she
could
do
to
hold
it.
As
soon
as
she
had
made
out
the
proper
way
of
nursing
it,
(which
was
to
twist
it
up
into
a
sort
of
knot,
and
then
keep
tight
hold
of
its
right
ear
and
left
foot,
so
as
to
prevent
its
undoing
itself,)
he
carried
it
out
into
the
open
air.
‘IF
don’t
ke
this
child
away
with
me,’
ought
Alice,
‘they’re
to
kill
it
in
a
day
or
two:
wouldn’t
be
murder
to
leave
it
behind?’
said
the
last
words
out
loud,
and
the
little
thing
grunted
in
reply
(it
had
left
off
sneezing
by
this
time).
‘Don’t
,’
d
Alice;
‘that’s
t
all
a
proper
way
of
expressing
yourself.’
The
baby
grunted
again,
and
Alice
looked
very
anxiously
into
its
face
to
see
what
was
the
matter
with
it.
There
could
be
no
doubt
that
it
had
a
VERY
turn-up
nose,
much
more
like
a
snout
than
a
real
nose;
also
its
eyes
were
getting
extremely
small
for
a
baby:
altogether
Alice
did
not
like
the
look
of
the
thing
at
all.
‘But
rhaps
it
was
only
sobbing,’
e
thought,
and
looked
into
its
eyes
again,
to
see
if
there
were
any
tears.
No,
there
were
no
tears.
‘If
u’re
ing
to
turn
into
a
pig,
my
dear,’
id
Alice,
seriously,
‘I’ll
nothing
more
to
do
with
you.
Mind
now!’
poor
little
thing
sobbed
again
(or
grunted,
it
was
impossible
to
say
which),
nd
they
went
on
for
some
while
in
silence.
Alice
was
just
beginning
to
think
to
herself,
‘Now,
t
am
I
to
do
with
this
creature
when
I
get
it
home?’
n
it
grunted
again,
so
violently,
that
she
looked
down
into
its
face
in
some
alarm.
This
time
there
could
be
NO
mistake
about
it:
it
was
neither
more
nor
less
than
a
pig,
and
she
felt
that
it
would
be
quite
absurd
for
her
to
carry
it
further.
So
she
set
the
little
creature
down,
and
felt
quite
relieved
to
see
it
trot
away
quietly
into
the
wood.
‘If
had
grown
up,’
said
to
herself,
‘it
uld
have
made
a
dreadfully
ugly
child:
but
it
makes
rather
a
handsome
pig,
I
think.’
she
began
thinking
over
other
children
she
knew,
who
might
do
very
well
as
pigs,
and
was
just
saying
to
herself,
‘if
e
only
knew
the
right
way
to
change
them--’
she
was
a
little
startled
by
seeing
the
Cheshire
Cat
sitting
on
a
bough
of
a
tree
a
few
yards
off.
The
Cat
only
grinned
when
it
saw
Alice.
It
looked
good-natured,
he
thought:
still
it
had
VERY
long
claws
and
a
great
many
teeth,
so
she
felt
that
it
ought
to
be
treated
with
respect.
‘Cheshire
ss,’
began,
rather
timidly,
as
she
did
not
at
all
know
whether
it
would
like
the
name:
however,
it
only
grinned
a
little
wider.
‘Come,
s
leased
so
far,’
ught
Alice,
and
she
went
on.
‘Would
u
tell
me,
please,
which
way
I
ought
to
go
from
here?’
‘That
pends
a
good
deal
on
where
you
want
to
get
to,’
d
the
Cat.
‘I
n’t
ch
care
where--’
Alice.
‘Then
doesn’t
tter
which
way
you
go,’
d
the
Cat.
‘--so
as
I
get
SOMEWHERE,’
ce
added
as
an
explanation.
‘Oh,
’re
re
to
do
that,’
d
the
Cat,
‘if
u
only
walk
long
enough.’
Alice
felt
that
this
could
not
be
denied,
so
she
tried
another
question.
‘What
rt
of
people
live
about
here?’
‘In
AT
direction,’
Cat
said,
waving
its
right
paw
round,
‘lives
Hatter:
and
in
THAT
direction,’
ing
the
other
paw,
‘lives
March
Hare.
Visit
either
you
like:
they’re
th
mad.’
‘But
don’t
nt
to
go
among
mad
people,’
ce
remarked.
‘Oh,
can’t
lp
that,’
d
the
Cat:
‘we’re
ad
here.
I’m
d.
You’re
d.’
‘How
you
know
I’m
d?’
d
Alice.
‘You
st
be,’
d
the
Cat,
‘or
u
wouldn’t
ve
come
here.’
Alice
didn’t
ink
that
proved
it
at
all;
however,
she
went
on
‘And
w
do
you
know
that
you’re
d?’
‘To
gin
with,’
d
the
Cat,
‘a
g’s
t
mad.
You
grant
that?’
‘I
ppose
so,’
d
Alice.
‘Well,
n,’
Cat
went
on,
‘you
e,
a
dog
growls
when
it’s
gry,
and
wags
its
tail
when
it’s
eased.
Now
I
growl
when
I’m
eased,
and
wag
my
tail
when
I’m
gry.
Therefore
I’m
d.’
‘I
ll
it
purring,
not
growling,’
d
Alice.
‘Call
what
you
like,’
d
the
Cat.
‘Do
u
play
croquet
with
the
Queen
to-day?’
I
hould
like
it
very
much,’
d
Alice,
‘but
haven’t
en
invited
yet.’
‘You’ll
e
there,’
d
the
Cat,
and
vanished.
Alice
was
not
much
surprised
at
this,
she
was
getting
so
used
to
queer
things
happening.
While
she
was
looking
at
the
place
where
it
had
been,
it
suddenly
appeared
again.
‘By-the-bye,
became
of
the
baby?’
d
the
Cat.
‘I’d
y
forgotten
to
ask.’
‘It
rned
into
a
pig,’
ce
quietly
said,
just
as
if
it
had
come
back
in
a
natural
way.
‘I
ought
it
would,’
d
the
Cat,
and
vanished
again.
Alice
waited
a
little,
half
expecting
to
see
it
again,
but
it
did
not
appear,
and
after
a
minute
or
two
she
walked
on
in
the
direction
in
which
the
March
Hare
was
said
to
live.
‘I’ve
hatters
before,’
said
to
herself;
‘the
rch
Hare
will
be
much
the
most
interesting,
and
perhaps
as
this
is
May
it
won’t
raving
mad--at
east
not
so
mad
as
it
was
in
March.’
she
said
this,
she
looked
up,
and
there
was
the
Cat
again,
sitting
on
a
branch
of
a
tree.
‘Did
u
say
pig,
or
fig?’
d
the
Cat.
‘I
id
pig,’
lied
Alice;
‘and
wish
you
wouldn’t
ep
appearing
and
vanishing
so
suddenly:
you
make
one
quite
giddy.’
‘All
ght,’
d
the
Cat;
and
this
time
it
vanished
quite
slowly,
beginning
with
the
end
of
the
tail,
and
ending
with
the
grin,
which
remained
some
time
after
the
rest
of
it
had
gone.
‘Well!
ve
often
seen
a
cat
without
a
grin,’
ught
Alice;
‘but
grin
without
a
cat!
It’s
e
most
curious
thing
I
ever
saw
in
my
life!’
She
had
not
gone
much
farther
before
she
came
in
sight
of
the
house
of
the
March
Hare:
she
thought
it
must
be
the
right
house,
because
the
chimneys
were
shaped
like
ears
and
the
roof
was
thatched
with
fur.
It
was
so
large
a
house,
that
she
did
not
like
to
go
nearer
till
she
had
nibbled
some
more
of
the
lefthand
bit
of
mushroom,
and
raised
herself
to
about
two
feet
high:
even
then
she
walked
up
towards
it
rather
timidly,
saying
to
herself
‘Suppose
should
be
raving
mad
after
all!
I
almost
wish
I’d
ne
to
see
the
Hatter
instead!’
CHAPTER
VII.
A
Mad
Tea-Party
There
was
a
table
set
out
under
a
tree
in
front
of
the
house,
and
the
March
Hare
and
the
Hatter
were
having
tea
at
it:
a
Dormouse
was
sitting
between
them,
fast
asleep,
and
the
other
two
were
using
it
as
a
cushion,
resting
their
elbows
on
it,
and
talking
over
its
head.
‘Very
ncomfortable
for
the
Dormouse,’
ught
Alice;
‘only,
it’s
leep,
I
suppose
it
doesn’t
nd.’
The
table
was
a
large
one,
but
the
three
were
all
crowded
together
at
one
corner
of
it:
‘No
om!
No
room!’
y
cried
out
when
they
saw
Alice
coming.
‘There’s
Y
of
room!’
d
Alice
indignantly,
and
she
sat
down
in
a
large
arm-chair
at
one
end
of
the
table.
‘Have
me
wine,’
March
Hare
said
in
an
encouraging
tone.
Alice
looked
all
round
the
table,
but
there
was
nothing
on
it
but
tea.
‘I
n’t
e
any
wine,’
remarked.
‘There
n’t
y,’
d
the
March
Hare.
‘Then
wasn’t
ry
civil
of
you
to
offer
it,’
d
Alice
angrily.
‘It
sn’t
ry
civil
of
you
to
sit
down
without
being
invited,’
d
the
March
Hare.
‘I
dn’t
ow
it
was
YOUR
table,’
d
Alice;
‘it’s
for
a
great
many
more
than
three.’
‘Your
ir
wants
cutting,’
d
the
Hatter.
He
had
been
looking
at
Alice
for
some
time
with
great
curiosity,
and
this
was
his
first
speech.
‘You
ould
learn
not
to
make
personal
remarks,’
ce
said
with
some
severity;
‘it’s
rude.’
The
Hatter
opened
his
eyes
very
wide
on
hearing
this;
but
all
he
SAID
was,
‘Why
a
raven
like
a
writing-desk?’
Come,
shall
have
some
fun
now!’
ught
Alice.
‘I’m
they’ve
egun
asking
riddles.--I
lieve
I
can
guess
that,’
added
aloud.
‘Do
u
mean
that
you
think
you
can
find
out
the
answer
to
it?’
d
the
March
Hare.
‘Exactly
,’
d
Alice.
‘Then
u
should
say
what
you
mean,’
March
Hare
went
on.
‘I
,’
ce
hastily
replied;
‘at
ast--at
east
I
mean
what
I
say--that’s
same
thing,
you
know.’
‘Not
e
same
thing
a
bit!’
d
the
Hatter.
‘You
ght
just
as
well
say
that
“I
e
what
I
eat”
the
same
thing
as
“I
t
what
I
see”!’
You
might
just
as
well
say,’
ed
the
March
Hare,
‘that
I
like
what
I
get”
the
same
thing
as
“I
t
what
I
like”!’
You
might
just
as
well
say,’
ed
the
Dormouse,
who
seemed
to
be
talking
in
his
sleep,
‘that
I
breathe
when
I
sleep”
the
same
thing
as
“I
eep
when
I
breathe”!’
It
IS
the
same
thing
with
you,’
d
the
Hatter,
and
here
the
conversation
dropped,
and
the
party
sat
silent
for
a
minute,
while
Alice
thought
over
all
she
could
remember
about
ravens
and
writing-desks,
which
wasn’t
ch.
The
Hatter
was
the
first
to
break
the
silence.
‘What
y
of
the
month
is
it?’
said,
turning
to
Alice:
he
had
taken
his
watch
out
of
his
pocket,
and
was
looking
at
it
uneasily,
shaking
it
every
now
and
then,
and
holding
it
to
his
ear.
Alice
considered
a
little,
and
then
said
‘The
urth.’
‘Two
ys
wrong!’
hed
the
Hatter.
‘I
ld
you
butter
wouldn’t
it
the
works!’
added
looking
angrily
at
the
March
Hare.
‘It
s
the
BEST
butter,’
March
Hare
meekly
replied.
‘Yes,
some
crumbs
must
have
got
in
as
well,’
Hatter
grumbled:
‘you
ouldn’t
ve
put
it
in
with
the
bread-knife.’
he
March
Hare
took
the
watch
and
looked
at
it
gloomily:
then
he
dipped
it
into
his
cup
of
tea,
and
looked
at
it
again:
but
he
could
think
of
nothing
better
to
say
than
his
first
remark,
‘It
s
the
BEST
butter,
you
know.’
Alice
had
been
looking
over
his
shoulder
with
some
curiosity.
‘What
funny
watch!’
remarked.
‘It
lls
the
day
of
the
month,
and
doesn’t
ell
what
o’clock
is!’
‘Why
ould
it?’
tered
the
Hatter.
‘Does
UR
watch
tell
you
what
year
it
is?’
‘Of
urse
not,’
ce
replied
very
readily:
‘but
at’s
cause
it
stays
the
same
year
for
such
a
long
time
together.’
‘Which
just
the
case
with
MINE,’
d
the
Hatter.
Alice
felt
dreadfully
puzzled.
The
Hatter’s
mark
seemed
to
have
no
sort
of
meaning
in
it,
and
yet
it
was
certainly
English.
‘I
n’t
ite
understand
you,’
said,
as
politely
as
she
could.
‘The
rmouse
is
asleep
again,’
d
the
Hatter,
and
he
poured
a
little
hot
tea
upon
its
nose.
The
Dormouse
shook
its
head
impatiently,
and
said,
without
opening
its
eyes,
‘Of
urse,
of
course;
just
what
I
was
going
to
remark
myself.’
‘Have
u
guessed
the
riddle
yet?’
Hatter
said,
turning
to
Alice
again.
‘No,
ive
it
up,’
ce
replied:
‘what’s
nswer?’
‘I
ven’t
e
slightest
idea,’
d
the
Hatter.
‘Nor
’
id
the
March
Hare.
Alice
sighed
wearily.
‘I
ink
you
might
do
something
better
with
the
time,’
said,
‘than
ste
it
in
asking
riddles
that
have
no
answers.’
‘If
u
knew
Time
as
well
as
I
do,’
d
the
Hatter,
‘you
uldn’t
lk
about
wasting
IT.
It’s
M.’
‘I
n’t
ow
what
you
mean,’
d
Alice.
‘Of
urse
you
don’t!’
tter
said,
tossing
his
head
contemptuously.
‘I
re
say
you
never
even
spoke
to
Time!’
‘Perhaps
t,’
ce
cautiously
replied:
‘but
know
I
have
to
beat
time
when
I
learn
music.’
‘Ah!
t
accounts
for
it,’
d
the
Hatter.
‘He
n’t
and
beating.
Now,
if
you
only
kept
on
good
terms
with
him,
he’d
almost
anything
you
liked
with
the
clock.
For
instance,
suppose
it
were
nine
o’clock
the
morning,
just
time
to
begin
lessons:
you’d
ly
have
to
whisper
a
hint
to
Time,
and
round
goes
the
clock
in
a
twinkling!
Half-past
one,
time
for
dinner!’
[‘I
y
wish
it
was,’
March
Hare
said
to
itself
in
a
whisper.)
‘That
uld
be
grand,
certainly,’
d
Alice
thoughtfully:
‘but
en--I
shouldn’t
hungry
for
it,
you
know.’
‘Not
first,
perhaps,’
d
the
Hatter:
‘but
u
could
keep
it
to
half-past
one
as
long
as
you
liked.’
‘Is
at
the
way
YOU
manage?’
ce
asked.
The
Hatter
shook
his
head
mournfully.
‘Not
’
replied.
‘We
uarrelled
last
March--just
efore
HE
went
mad,
you
know--’
nting
with
his
tea
spoon
at
the
March
Hare,)
--it
at
the
great
concert
given
by
the
Queen
of
Hearts,
and
I
had
to
sing
“Twinkle,
nkle,
little
bat!
How
I
wonder
what
you’re
!”
You
know
the
song,
perhaps?’
‘I’ve
something
like
it,’
d
Alice.
‘It
es
on,
you
know,’
Hatter
continued,
‘in
is
way:--
“Up
ove
the
world
you
fly,
Like
a
tea-tray
in
the
sky.
Twinkle,
twinkle--“’
the
Dormouse
shook
itself,
and
began
singing
in
its
sleep
‘Twinkle,
inkle,
twinkle,
twinkle--’
went
on
so
long
that
they
had
to
pinch
it
to
make
it
stop.
‘Well,
d
hardly
finished
the
first
verse,’
d
the
Hatter,
‘when
e
Queen
jumped
up
and
bawled
out,
“He’s
ring
the
time!
Off
with
his
head!”’
How
dreadfully
savage!’
laimed
Alice.
‘And
er
since
that,’
Hatter
went
on
in
a
mournful
tone,
‘he
n’t
o
a
thing
I
ask!
It’s
ways
six
o’clock
w.’
A
bright
idea
came
into
Alice’s
ad.
‘Is
at
the
reason
so
many
tea-things
are
put
out
here?’
asked.
‘Yes,
t’s
,’
d
the
Hatter
with
a
sigh:
‘it’s
s
tea-time,
and
we’ve
time
to
wash
the
things
between
whiles.’
‘Then
u
keep
moving
round,
I
suppose?’
d
Alice.
‘Exactly
,’
d
the
Hatter:
‘as
e
things
get
used
up.’
‘But
at
happens
when
you
come
to
the
beginning
again?’
ce
ventured
to
ask.
‘Suppose
change
the
subject,’
March
Hare
interrupted,
yawning.
‘I’m
ng
tired
of
this.
I
vote
the
young
lady
tells
us
a
story.’
‘I’m
d
I
don’t
ow
one,’
d
Alice,
rather
alarmed
at
the
proposal.
‘Then
e
Dormouse
shall!’
y
both
cried.
‘Wake
,
Dormouse!’
they
pinched
it
on
both
sides
at
once.
The
Dormouse
slowly
opened
his
eyes.
‘I
sn’t
leep,’
said
in
a
hoarse,
feeble
voice:
‘I
ard
every
word
you
fellows
were
saying.’
‘Tell
a
story!’
d
the
March
Hare.
‘Yes,
ase
do!’
aded
Alice.
‘And
quick
about
it,’
ed
the
Hatter,
‘or
u’ll
asleep
again
before
it’s
ne.’
‘Once
on
a
time
there
were
three
little
sisters,’
Dormouse
began
in
a
great
hurry;
‘and
eir
names
were
Elsie,
Lacie,
and
Tillie;
and
they
lived
at
the
bottom
of
a
well--’
What
id
they
live
on?’
d
Alice,
who
always
took
a
great
interest
in
questions
of
eating
and
drinking.
‘They
ved
on
treacle,’
d
the
Dormouse,
after
thinking
a
minute
or
two.
‘They
uldn’t
ve
done
that,
you
know,’
ce
gently
remarked;
‘they’d
been
ill.’
‘So
ey
were,’
d
the
Dormouse;
‘VERY
l.’
Alice
tried
to
fancy
to
herself
what
such
an
extraordinary
ways
of
living
would
be
like,
but
it
puzzled
her
too
much,
so
she
went
on:
‘But
hy
did
they
live
at
the
bottom
of
a
well?’
‘Take
me
more
tea,’
March
Hare
said
to
Alice,
very
earnestly.
‘I’ve
othing
yet,’
ce
replied
in
an
offended
tone,
‘so
can’t
ake
more.’
‘You
an
you
can’t
ke
LESS,’
d
the
Hatter:
‘it’s
easy
to
take
MORE
than
nothing.’
‘Nobody
ked
YOUR
opinion,’
d
Alice.
‘Who’s
g
personal
remarks
now?’
Hatter
asked
triumphantly.
Alice
did
not
quite
know
what
to
say
to
this:
so
she
helped
herself
to
some
tea
and
bread-and-butter,
d
then
turned
to
the
Dormouse,
and
repeated
her
question.
‘Why
d
they
live
at
the
bottom
of
a
well?’
The
Dormouse
again
took
a
minute
or
two
to
think
about
it,
and
then
said,
‘It
s
a
treacle-well.’
There’s
uch
thing!’
ce
was
beginning
very
angrily,
but
the
Hatter
and
the
March
Hare
went
‘Sh!
’
d
the
Dormouse
sulkily
remarked,
‘If
u
can’t
civil,
you’d
tter
finish
the
story
for
yourself.’
‘No,
ase
go
on!’
ce
said
very
humbly;
‘I
n’t
terrupt
again.
I
dare
say
there
may
be
ONE.’
‘One,
eed!’
d
the
Dormouse
indignantly.
However,
he
consented
to
go
on.
‘And
these
three
little
sisters--they
ere
learning
to
draw,
you
know--’
What
id
they
draw?’
d
Alice,
quite
forgetting
her
promise.
‘Treacle,’
he
Dormouse,
without
considering
at
all
this
time.
‘I
nt
a
clean
cup,’
errupted
the
Hatter:
‘let’s
ove
one
place
on.’
He
moved
on
as
he
spoke,
and
the
Dormouse
followed
him:
the
March
Hare
moved
into
the
Dormouse’s
ace,
and
Alice
rather
unwillingly
took
the
place
of
the
March
Hare.
The
Hatter
was
the
only
one
who
got
any
advantage
from
the
change:
and
Alice
was
a
good
deal
worse
off
than
before,
as
the
March
Hare
had
just
upset
the
milk-jug
into
his
plate.
Alice
did
not
wish
to
offend
the
Dormouse
again,
so
she
began
very
cautiously:
‘But
don’t
derstand.
Where
did
they
draw
the
treacle
from?’
‘You
n
draw
water
out
of
a
water-well,’
the
Hatter;
‘so
should
think
you
could
draw
treacle
out
of
a
treacle-well--eh,
pid?’
‘But
ey
were
IN
the
well,’
ce
said
to
the
Dormouse,
not
choosing
to
notice
this
last
remark.
‘Of
urse
they
were’,
d
the
Dormouse;
‘--well

This
answer
so
confused
poor
Alice,
that
she
let
the
Dormouse
go
on
for
some
time
without
interrupting
it.
‘They
re
learning
to
draw,’
Dormouse
went
on,
yawning
and
rubbing
its
eyes,
for
it
was
getting
very
sleepy;
‘and
ey
drew
all
manner
of
things--everything
hat
begins
with
an
M--’
Why
ith
an
M?’
d
Alice.
‘Why
t?’
d
the
March
Hare.
Alice
was
silent.
The
Dormouse
had
closed
its
eyes
by
this
time,
and
was
going
off
into
a
doze;
but,
on
being
pinched
by
the
Hatter,
it
woke
up
again
with
a
little
shriek,
and
went
on:
‘--that
ns
with
an
M,
such
as
mouse-traps,
nd
the
moon,
and
memory,
and
muchness--you
now
you
say
things
are
“much
a
muchness”--did
ever
see
such
a
thing
as
a
drawing
of
a
muchness?’
‘Really,
you
ask
me,’
d
Alice,
very
much
confused,
‘I
n’t
hink--’
Then
ou
shouldn’t
lk,’
d
the
Hatter.
This
piece
of
rudeness
was
more
than
Alice
could
bear:
she
got
up
in
great
disgust,
and
walked
off;
the
Dormouse
fell
asleep
instantly,
and
neither
of
the
others
took
the
least
notice
of
her
going,
though
she
looked
back
once
or
twice,
half
hoping
that
they
would
call
after
her:
the
last
time
she
saw
them,
they
were
trying
to
put
the
Dormouse
into
the
teapot.
‘At
y
rate
I’ll
ver
go
THERE
again!’
d
Alice
as
she
picked
her
way
through
the
wood.
‘It’s
tupidest
tea-party
I
ever
was
at
in
all
my
life!’
Just
as
she
said
this,
she
noticed
that
one
of
the
trees
had
a
door
leading
right
into
it.
‘That’s
curious!’
thought.
‘But
verything’s
rious
today.
I
think
I
may
as
well
go
in
at
once.’
in
she
went.
Once
more
she
found
herself
in
the
long
hall,
and
close
to
the
little
glass
table.
‘Now,
ll
manage
better
this
time,’
said
to
herself,
and
began
by
taking
the
little
golden
key,
and
unlocking
the
door
that
led
into
the
garden.
Then
she
went
to
work
nibbling
at
the
mushroom
(she
had
kept
a
piece
of
it
in
her
pocket)
till
she
was
about
a
foot
high:
then
she
walked
down
the
little
passage:
and
THEN--she
ound
herself
at
last
in
the
beautiful
garden,
among
the
bright
flower-beds
and
the
cool
fountains.
CHAPTER
VIII.
The
Queen’s
oquet-Ground
A
large
rose-tree
stood
near
the
entrance
of
the
garden:
the
roses
growing
on
it
were
white,
but
there
were
three
gardeners
at
it,
busily
painting
them
red.
Alice
thought
this
a
very
curious
thing,
and
she
went
nearer
to
watch
them,
and
just
as
she
came
up
to
them
she
heard
one
of
them
say,
‘Look
t
now,
Five!
Don’t
splashing
paint
over
me
like
that!’
‘I
uldn’t
lp
it,’
d
Five,
in
a
sulky
tone;
‘Seven
gged
my
elbow.’
On
which
Seven
looked
up
and
said,
‘That’s
,
Five!
Always
lay
the
blame
on
others!’
‘YOU’D
r
not
talk!’
d
Five.
‘I
ard
the
Queen
say
only
yesterday
you
deserved
to
be
beheaded!’
‘What
r?’
d
the
one
who
had
spoken
first.
‘That’s
of
YOUR
business,
Two!’
d
Seven.
‘Yes,
IS
his
business!’
d
Five,
‘and
ll
ell
him--it
as
for
bringing
the
cook
tulip-roots
instead
of
onions.’
Seven
flung
down
his
brush,
and
had
just
begun
‘Well,
all
the
unjust
things--’
his
eye
chanced
to
fall
upon
Alice,
as
she
stood
watching
them,
and
he
checked
himself
suddenly:
the
others
looked
round
also,
and
all
of
them
bowed
low.
‘Would
u
tell
me,’
d
Alice,
a
little
timidly,
‘why
u
are
painting
those
roses?’
Five
and
Seven
said
nothing,
but
looked
at
Two.
Two
began
in
a
low
voice,
‘Why
e
fact
is,
you
see,
Miss,
this
here
ought
to
have
been
a
RED
rose-tree,
nd
we
put
a
white
one
in
by
mistake;
and
if
the
Queen
was
to
find
it
out,
we
should
all
have
our
heads
cut
off,
you
know.
So
you
see,
Miss,
we’re
ing
our
best,
afore
she
comes,
to--’
his
moment
Five,
who
had
been
anxiously
looking
across
the
garden,
called
out
‘The
een!
The
Queen!’
the
three
gardeners
instantly
threw
themselves
flat
upon
their
faces.
There
was
a
sound
of
many
footsteps,
and
Alice
looked
round,
eager
to
see
the
Queen.
First
came
ten
soldiers
carrying
clubs;
these
were
all
shaped
like
the
three
gardeners,
oblong
and
flat,
with
their
hands
and
feet
at
the
corners:
next
the
ten
courtiers;
these
were
ornamented
all
over
with
diamonds,
and
walked
two
and
two,
as
the
soldiers
did.
After
these
came
the
royal
children;
there
were
ten
of
them,
and
the
little
dears
came
jumping
merrily
along
hand
in
hand,
in
couples:
they
were
all
ornamented
with
hearts.
Next
came
the
guests,
mostly
Kings
and
Queens,
and
among
them
Alice
recognised
the
White
Rabbit:
it
was
talking
in
a
hurried
nervous
manner,
smiling
at
everything
that
was
said,
and
went
by
without
noticing
her.
Then
followed
the
Knave
of
Hearts,
carrying
the
King’s
rown
on
a
crimson
velvet
cushion;
and,
last
of
all
this
grand
procession,
came
THE
KING
AND
QUEEN
OF
HEARTS.
Alice
was
rather
doubtful
whether
she
ought
not
to
lie
down
on
her
face
like
the
three
gardeners,
but
she
could
not
remember
ever
having
heard
of
such
a
rule
at
processions;
‘and
sides,
what
would
be
the
use
of
a
procession,’
ught
she,
‘if
ople
had
all
to
lie
down
upon
their
faces,
so
that
they
couldn’t
e
it?’
she
stood
still
where
she
was,
and
waited.
When
the
procession
came
opposite
to
Alice,
they
all
stopped
and
looked
at
her,
and
the
Queen
said
severely
‘Who
this?’
said
it
to
the
Knave
of
Hearts,
who
only
bowed
and
smiled
in
reply.
‘Idiot!’
he
Queen,
tossing
her
head
impatiently;
and,
turning
to
Alice,
she
went
on,
‘What’s
name,
child?’
‘My
me
is
Alice,
so
please
your
Majesty,’
d
Alice
very
politely;
but
she
added,
to
herself,
‘Why,
y’re
ly
a
pack
of
cards,
after
all.
I
needn’t
afraid
of
them!’
‘And
o
are
THESE?’
d
the
Queen,
pointing
to
the
three
gardeners
who
were
lying
round
the
rosetree;
for,
you
see,
as
they
were
lying
on
their
faces,
and
the
pattern
on
their
backs
was
the
same
as
the
rest
of
the
pack,
she
could
not
tell
whether
they
were
gardeners,
or
soldiers,
or
courtiers,
or
three
of
her
own
children.
‘How
ould
I
know?’
d
Alice,
surprised
at
her
own
courage.
‘It’s
usiness
of
MINE.’
The
Queen
turned
crimson
with
fury,
and,
after
glaring
at
her
for
a
moment
like
a
wild
beast,
screamed
‘Off
th
her
head!
Off--’
Nonsense!’
Alice,
very
loudly
and
decidedly,
and
the
Queen
was
silent.
The
King
laid
his
hand
upon
her
arm,
and
timidly
said
‘Consider,
dear:
she
is
only
a
child!’
The
Queen
turned
angrily
away
from
him,
and
said
to
the
Knave
‘Turn
em
over!’
The
Knave
did
so,
very
carefully,
with
one
foot.
‘Get
!’
d
the
Queen,
in
a
shrill,
loud
voice,
and
the
three
gardeners
instantly
jumped
up,
and
began
bowing
to
the
King,
the
Queen,
the
royal
children,
and
everybody
else.
‘Leave
f
that!’
eamed
the
Queen.
‘You
ke
me
giddy.’
then,
turning
to
the
rose-tree,
he
went
on,
‘What
VE
you
been
doing
here?’
‘May
please
your
Majesty,’
d
Two,
in
a
very
humble
tone,
going
down
on
one
knee
as
he
spoke,
‘we
re
trying--’
I
ee!’
d
the
Queen,
who
had
meanwhile
been
examining
the
roses.
‘Off
th
their
heads!’
the
procession
moved
on,
three
of
the
soldiers
remaining
behind
to
execute
the
unfortunate
gardeners,
who
ran
to
Alice
for
protection.
‘You
an’t
beheaded!’
d
Alice,
and
she
put
them
into
a
large
flower-pot
that
stood
near.
The
three
soldiers
wandered
about
for
a
minute
or
two,
looking
for
them,
and
then
quietly
marched
off
after
the
others.
‘Are
eir
heads
off?’
uted
the
Queen.
‘Their
ads
are
gone,
if
it
please
your
Majesty!’
soldiers
shouted
in
reply.
‘That’s
!’
uted
the
Queen.
‘Can
u
play
croquet?’
The
soldiers
were
silent,
and
looked
at
Alice,
as
the
question
was
evidently
meant
for
her.
‘Yes!’
d
Alice.
‘Come
,
then!’
red
the
Queen,
and
Alice
joined
the
procession,
wondering
very
much
what
would
happen
next.
‘It’s--it’s
e
day!’
d
a
timid
voice
at
her
side.
She
was
walking
by
the
White
Rabbit,
who
was
peeping
anxiously
into
her
face.
‘Very,’
lice:
‘--where’s
hess?’
‘Hush!
h!’
d
the
Rabbit
in
a
low,
hurried
tone.
He
looked
anxiously
over
his
shoulder
as
he
spoke,
and
then
raised
himself
upon
tiptoe,
put
his
mouth
close
to
her
ear,
and
whispered
‘She’s
sentence
of
execution.’
‘What
r?’
d
Alice.
‘Did
u
say
“What
pity!”?’
bit
asked.
‘No,
idn’t,’
lice:
‘I
n’t
ink
it’s
all
a
pity.
I
said
“What
r?”’
She
boxed
the
Queen’s
rs--’
Rabbit
began.
Alice
gave
a
little
scream
of
laughter.
‘Oh,
h!’
Rabbit
whispered
in
a
frightened
tone.
‘The
een
will
hear
you!
You
see,
she
came
rather
late,
and
the
Queen
said--’
Get
o
your
places!’
uted
the
Queen
in
a
voice
of
thunder,
and
people
began
running
about
in
all
directions,
tumbling
up
against
each
other;
however,
they
got
settled
down
in
a
minute
or
two,
and
the
game
began.
Alice
thought
she
had
never
seen
such
a
curious
croquet-ground
in
her
life;
it
was
all
ridges
and
furrows;
the
balls
were
live
hedgehogs,
the
mallets
live
flamingoes,
and
the
soldiers
had
to
double
themselves
up
and
to
stand
on
their
hands
and
feet,
to
make
the
arches.
The
chief
difficulty
Alice
found
at
first
was
in
managing
her
flamingo:
she
succeeded
in
getting
its
body
tucked
away,
comfortably
enough,
under
her
arm,
with
its
legs
hanging
down,
but
generally,
just
as
she
had
got
its
neck
nicely
straightened
out,
and
was
going
to
give
the
hedgehog
a
blow
with
its
head,
it
WOULD
twist
itself
round
and
look
up
in
her
face,
with
such
a
puzzled
expression
that
she
could
not
help
bursting
out
laughing:
and
when
she
had
got
its
head
down,
and
was
going
to
begin
again,
it
was
very
provoking
to
find
that
the
hedgehog
had
unrolled
itself,
and
was
in
the
act
of
crawling
away:
besides
all
this,
there
was
generally
a
ridge
or
furrow
in
the
way
wherever
she
wanted
to
send
the
hedgehog
to,
and,
as
the
doubled-up
soldiers
were
always
getting
up
and
walking
off
to
other
parts
of
the
ground,
Alice
soon
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
a
very
difficult
game
indeed.
The
players
all
played
at
once
without
waiting
for
turns,
quarrelling
all
the
while,
and
fighting
for
the
hedgehogs;
and
in
a
very
short
time
the
Queen
was
in
a
furious
passion,
and
went
stamping
about,
and
shouting
‘Off
th
his
head!’
‘Off
th
her
head!’
ut
once
in
a
minute.
Alice
began
to
feel
very
uneasy:
to
be
sure,
she
had
not
as
yet
had
any
dispute
with
the
Queen,
but
she
knew
that
it
might
happen
any
minute,
‘and
en,’
ught
she,
‘what
uld
become
of
me?
They’re
eadfully
fond
of
beheading
people
here;
the
great
wonder
is,
that
there’s
y
one
left
alive!’
She
was
looking
about
for
some
way
of
escape,
and
wondering
whether
she
could
get
away
without
being
seen,
when
she
noticed
a
curious
appearance
in
the
air:
it
puzzled
her
very
much
at
first,
but,
after
watching
it
a
minute
or
two,
she
made
it
out
to
be
a
grin,
and
she
said
to
herself
‘It’s
heshire
Cat:
now
I
shall
have
somebody
to
talk
to.’
‘How
e
you
getting
on?’
d
the
Cat,
as
soon
as
there
was
mouth
enough
for
it
to
speak
with.
Alice
waited
till
the
eyes
appeared,
and
then
nodded.
‘It’s
e
speaking
to
it,’
thought,
‘till
s
ears
have
come,
or
at
least
one
of
them.’
another
minute
the
whole
head
appeared,
and
then
Alice
put
down
her
flamingo,
and
began
an
account
of
the
game,
feeling
very
glad
she
had
someone
to
listen
to
her.
The
Cat
seemed
to
think
that
there
was
enough
of
it
now
in
sight,
and
no
more
of
it
appeared.
‘I
n’t
ink
they
play
at
all
fairly,’
ce
began,
in
rather
a
complaining
tone,
‘and
ey
all
quarrel
so
dreadfully
one
can’t
ar
oneself
speak--and
hey
don’t
em
to
have
any
rules
in
particular;
at
least,
if
there
are,
nobody
attends
to
them--and
ou’ve
idea
how
confusing
it
is
all
the
things
being
alive;
for
instance,
there’s
e
arch
I’ve
t
to
go
through
next
walking
about
at
the
other
end
of
the
ground--and
should
have
croqueted
the
Queen’s
dgehog
just
now,
only
it
ran
away
when
it
saw
mine
coming!’
‘How
you
like
the
Queen?’
d
the
Cat
in
a
low
voice.
‘Not
all,’
d
Alice:
‘she’s
tremely--’
then
she
noticed
that
the
Queen
was
close
behind
her,
listening:
so
she
went
on,
‘--likely
in,
that
it’s
rdly
worth
while
finishing
the
game.’
The
Queen
smiled
and
passed
on.
‘Who
E
you
talking
to?’
d
the
King,
going
up
to
Alice,
and
looking
at
the
Cat’s
ad
with
great
curiosity.
‘It’s
end
of
mine--a
heshire
Cat,’
d
Alice:
‘allow
to
introduce
it.’
‘I
n’t
ke
the
look
of
it
at
all,’
d
the
King:
‘however,
may
kiss
my
hand
if
it
likes.’
‘I’d
r
not,’
Cat
remarked.
‘Don’t
pertinent,’
d
the
King,
‘and
n’t
ok
at
me
like
that!’
got
behind
Alice
as
he
spoke.
‘A
t
may
look
at
a
king,’
d
Alice.
‘I’ve
that
in
some
book,
but
I
don’t
member
where.’
‘Well,
must
be
removed,’
d
the
King
very
decidedly,
and
he
called
the
Queen,
who
was
passing
at
the
moment,
‘My
ar!
I
wish
you
would
have
this
cat
removed!’
The
Queen
had
only
one
way
of
settling
all
difficulties,
great
or
small.
‘Off
th
his
head!’
said,
without
even
looking
round.
‘I’ll
the
executioner
myself,’
d
the
King
eagerly,
and
he
hurried
off.
Alice
thought
she
might
as
well
go
back,
and
see
how
the
game
was
going
on,
as
she
heard
the
Queen’s
ice
in
the
distance,
screaming
with
passion.
She
had
already
heard
her
sentence
three
of
the
players
to
be
executed
for
having
missed
their
turns,
and
she
did
not
like
the
look
of
things
at
all,
as
the
game
was
in
such
confusion
that
she
never
knew
whether
it
was
her
turn
or
not.
So
she
went
in
search
of
her
hedgehog.
The
hedgehog
was
engaged
in
a
fight
with
another
hedgehog,
which
seemed
to
Alice
an
excellent
opportunity
for
croqueting
one
of
them
with
the
other:
the
only
difficulty
was,
that
her
flamingo
was
gone
across
to
the
other
side
of
the
garden,
where
Alice
could
see
it
trying
in
a
helpless
sort
of
way
to
fly
up
into
a
tree.
By
the
time
she
had
caught
the
flamingo
and
brought
it
back,
the
fight
was
over,
and
both
the
hedgehogs
were
out
of
sight:
‘but
doesn’t
atter
much,’
ught
Alice,
‘as
l
the
arches
are
gone
from
this
side
of
the
ground.’
she
tucked
it
away
under
her
arm,
that
it
might
not
escape
again,
and
went
back
for
a
little
more
conversation
with
her
friend.
When
she
got
back
to
the
Cheshire
Cat,
she
was
surprised
to
find
quite
a
large
crowd
collected
round
it:
there
was
a
dispute
going
on
between
the
executioner,
the
King,
and
the
Queen,
who
were
all
talking
at
once,
while
all
the
rest
were
quite
silent,
and
looked
very
uncomfortable.
The
moment
Alice
appeared,
she
was
appealed
to
by
all
three
to
settle
the
question,
and
they
repeated
their
arguments
to
her,
though,
as
they
all
spoke
at
once,
she
found
it
very
hard
indeed
to
make
out
exactly
what
they
said.
The
executioner’s
gument
was,
that
you
couldn’t
t
off
a
head
unless
there
was
a
body
to
cut
it
off
from:
that
he
had
never
had
to
do
such
a
thing
before,
and
he
wasn’t
ing
to
begin
at
HIS
time
of
life.
The
King’s
gument
was,
that
anything
that
had
a
head
could
be
beheaded,
and
that
you
weren’t
talk
nonsense.
The
Queen’s
gument
was,
that
if
something
wasn’t
ne
about
it
in
less
than
no
time
she’d
ve
everybody
executed,
all
round.
(It
was
this
last
remark
that
had
made
the
whole
party
look
so
grave
and
anxious.)
Alice
could
think
of
nothing
else
to
say
but
‘It
longs
to
the
Duchess:
you’d
tter
ask
HER
about
it.’
‘She’s
ison,’
Queen
said
to
the
executioner:
‘fetch
r
here.’
d
the
executioner
went
off
like
an
arrow.
The
Cat’s
ad
began
fading
away
the
moment
he
was
gone,
and,
by
the
time
he
had
come
back
with
the
Duchess,
it
had
entirely
disappeared;
so
the
King
and
the
executioner
ran
wildly
up
and
down
looking
for
it,
while
the
rest
of
the
party
went
back
to
the
game.
CHAPTER
IX.
The
Mock
Turtle’s
ory
‘You
n’t
ink
how
glad
I
am
to
see
you
again,
you
dear
old
thing!’
id
the
Duchess,
as
she
tucked
her
arm
affectionately
into
Alice’s,
they
walked
off
together.
Alice
was
very
glad
to
find
her
in
such
a
pleasant
temper,
and
thought
to
herself
that
perhaps
it
was
only
the
pepper
that
had
made
her
so
savage
when
they
met
in
the
kitchen.
‘When
M
Duchess,’
said
to
herself,
(not
in
a
very
hopeful
tone
though),
I
on’t
ve
any
pepper
in
my
kitchen
AT
ALL.
Soup
does
very
well
without--Maybe
t’s
ways
pepper
that
makes
people
hot-tempered,’
went
on,
very
much
pleased
at
having
found
out
a
new
kind
of
rule,
‘and
negar
that
makes
them
sour--and
amomile
that
makes
them
bitter--and--and
ley-sugar
and
such
things
that
make
children
sweet-tempered.
only
wish
people
knew
that:
then
they
wouldn’t
so
stingy
about
it,
you
know--’
he
had
quite
forgotten
the
Duchess
by
this
time,
and
was
a
little
startled
when
she
heard
her
voice
close
to
her
ear.
‘You’re
ing
about
something,
my
dear,
and
that
makes
you
forget
to
talk.
I
can’t
ell
you
just
now
what
the
moral
of
that
is,
but
I
shall
remember
it
in
a
bit.’
‘Perhaps
hasn’t
e,’
ce
ventured
to
remark.
‘Tut,
,
child!’
d
the
Duchess.
‘Everything’s
moral,
if
only
you
can
find
it.’
she
squeezed
herself
up
closer
to
Alice’s
de
as
she
spoke.
Alice
did
not
much
like
keeping
so
close
to
her:
first,
because
the
Duchess
was
VERY
ugly;
and
secondly,
because
she
was
exactly
the
right
height
to
rest
her
chin
upon
Alice’s
oulder,
and
it
was
an
uncomfortably
sharp
chin.
However,
she
did
not
like
to
be
rude,
so
she
bore
it
as
well
as
she
could.
‘The
me’s
ing
on
rather
better
now,’
said,
by
way
of
keeping
up
the
conversation
a
little.
‘’Tis

said
the
Duchess:
‘and
e
moral
of
that
is--“Oh,
s
love,
‘tis
ve,
that
makes
the
world
go
round!”’
Somebody
said,’
ce
whispered,
‘that
’s
ne
by
everybody
minding
their
own
business!’
‘Ah,
l!
It
means
much
the
same
thing,’
d
the
Duchess,
digging
her
sharp
little
chin
into
Alice’s
oulder
as
she
added,
‘and
e
moral
of
THAT
is--“Take
of
the
sense,
and
the
sounds
will
take
care
of
themselves.”’
How
fond
she
is
of
finding
morals
in
things!’
ce
thought
to
herself.
‘I
re
say
you’re
ndering
why
I
don’t
t
my
arm
round
your
waist,’
e
Duchess
said
after
a
pause:
‘the
ason
is,
that
I’m
ubtful
about
the
temper
of
your
flamingo.
Shall
I
try
the
experiment?’
‘HE
ght
bite,’
ce
cautiously
replied,
not
feeling
at
all
anxious
to
have
the
experiment
tried.
‘Very
ue,’
d
the
Duchess:
‘flamingoes
d
mustard
both
bite.
And
the
moral
of
that
is--“Birds
feather
flock
together.”’
Only
mustard
isn’t
bird,’
ce
remarked.
‘Right,
usual,’
d
the
Duchess:
‘what
clear
way
you
have
of
putting
things!’
‘It’s
eral,
I
THINK,’
d
Alice.
‘Of
urse
it
is,’
d
the
Duchess,
who
seemed
ready
to
agree
to
everything
that
Alice
said;
‘there’s
ge
mustard-mine
near
here.
And
the
moral
of
that
is--“The
there
is
of
mine,
the
less
there
is
of
yours.”’
Oh,
I
know!’
laimed
Alice,
who
had
not
attended
to
this
last
remark,
‘it’s
etable.
It
doesn’t
ok
like
one,
but
it
is.’
‘I
ite
agree
with
you,’
d
the
Duchess;
‘and
e
moral
of
that
is--“Be
you
would
seem
to
be”--or
ou’d
ke
it
put
more
simply--“Never
ine
yourself
not
to
be
otherwise
than
what
it
might
appear
to
others
that
what
you
were
or
might
have
been
was
not
otherwise
than
what
you
had
been
would
have
appeared
to
them
to
be
otherwise.”’
I
think
I
should
understand
that
better,’
ce
said
very
politely,
‘if
had
it
written
down:
but
I
can’t
ite
follow
it
as
you
say
it.’
‘That’s
ng
to
what
I
could
say
if
I
chose,’
Duchess
replied,
in
a
pleased
tone.
‘Pray
n’t
ouble
yourself
to
say
it
any
longer
than
that,’
d
Alice.
‘Oh,
’t
lk
about
trouble!’
d
the
Duchess.
‘I
ke
you
a
present
of
everything
I’ve
id
as
yet.’
‘A
eap
sort
of
present!’
ught
Alice.
‘I’m
they
don’t
ve
birthday
presents
like
that!’
she
did
not
venture
to
say
it
out
loud.
‘Thinking
ain?’
Duchess
asked,
with
another
dig
of
her
sharp
little
chin.
‘I’ve
ht
to
think,’
d
Alice
sharply,
for
she
was
beginning
to
feel
a
little
worried.
‘Just
out
as
much
right,’
d
the
Duchess,
‘as
gs
have
to
fly;
and
the
m--’
ut
here,
to
Alice’s
eat
surprise,
the
Duchess’s
ice
died
away,
even
in
the
middle
of
her
favourite
word
‘moral,’
e
arm
that
was
linked
into
hers
began
to
tremble.
Alice
looked
up,
and
there
stood
the
Queen
in
front
of
them,
with
her
arms
folded,
frowning
like
a
thunderstorm.
‘A
ne
day,
your
Majesty!’
Duchess
began
in
a
low,
weak
voice.
‘Now,
ive
you
fair
warning,’
uted
the
Queen,
stamping
on
the
ground
as
she
spoke;
‘either
u
or
your
head
must
be
off,
and
that
in
about
half
no
time!
Take
your
choice!’
The
Duchess
took
her
choice,
and
was
gone
in
a
moment.
‘Let’s
with
the
game,’
Queen
said
to
Alice;
and
Alice
was
too
much
frightened
to
say
a
word,
but
slowly
followed
her
back
to
the
croquet-ground.
The
other
guests
had
taken
advantage
of
the
Queen’s
sence,
and
were
resting
in
the
shade:
however,
the
moment
they
saw
her,
they
hurried
back
to
the
game,
the
Queen
merely
remarking
that
a
moment’s
lay
would
cost
them
their
lives.
All
the
time
they
were
playing
the
Queen
never
left
off
quarrelling
with
the
other
players,
and
shouting
‘Off
th
his
head!’
‘Off
th
her
head!’
se
whom
she
sentenced
were
taken
into
custody
by
the
soldiers,
who
of
course
had
to
leave
off
being
arches
to
do
this,
so
that
by
the
end
of
half
an
hour
or
so
there
were
no
arches
left,
and
all
the
players,
except
the
King,
the
Queen,
and
Alice,
were
in
custody
and
under
sentence
of
execution.
Then
the
Queen
left
off,
quite
out
of
breath,
and
said
to
Alice,
‘Have
ou
seen
the
Mock
Turtle
yet?’
‘No,’
lice.
‘I
n’t
en
know
what
a
Mock
Turtle
is.’
‘It’s
hing
Mock
Turtle
Soup
is
made
from,’
d
the
Queen.
‘I
ver
saw
one,
or
heard
of
one,’
d
Alice.
‘Come
,
then,’
d
the
Queen,
‘and
shall
tell
you
his
history,’
As
they
walked
off
together,
Alice
heard
the
King
say
in
a
low
voice,
to
the
company
generally,
‘You
e
all
pardoned.’
Come,
THAT’S
good
thing!’
said
to
herself,
for
she
had
felt
quite
unhappy
at
the
number
of
executions
the
Queen
had
ordered.
They
very
soon
came
upon
a
Gryphon,
lying
fast
asleep
in
the
sun.
(IF
you
don’t
ow
what
a
Gryphon
is,
look
at
the
picture.)
Up,
zy
thing!’
d
the
Queen,
‘and
ke
this
young
lady
to
see
the
Mock
Turtle,
and
to
hear
his
history.
I
must
go
back
and
see
after
some
executions
I
have
ordered’;
she
walked
off,
leaving
Alice
alone
with
the
Gryphon.
Alice
did
not
quite
like
the
look
of
the
creature,
but
on
the
whole
she
thought
it
would
be
quite
as
safe
to
stay
with
it
as
to
go
after
that
savage
Queen:
so
she
waited.
The
Gryphon
sat
up
and
rubbed
its
eyes:
then
it
watched
the
Queen
till
she
was
out
of
sight:
then
it
chuckled.
‘What
n!’
d
the
Gryphon,
half
to
itself,
half
to
Alice.
‘What
the
fun?’
d
Alice.
‘Why,
,’
d
the
Gryphon.
‘It’s
er
fancy,
that:
they
never
executes
nobody,
you
know.
Come
on!’
‘Everybody
ys
“come
!”
e,’
ught
Alice,
as
she
went
slowly
after
it:
‘I
ver
was
so
ordered
about
in
all
my
life,
never!’
They
had
not
gone
far
before
they
saw
the
Mock
Turtle
in
the
distance,
sitting
sad
and
lonely
on
a
little
ledge
of
rock,
and,
as
they
came
nearer,
Alice
could
hear
him
sighing
as
if
his
heart
would
break.
She
pitied
him
deeply.
‘What
his
sorrow?’
asked
the
Gryphon,
and
the
Gryphon
answered,
very
nearly
in
the
same
words
as
before,
‘It’s
is
fancy,
that:
he
hasn’t
t
no
sorrow,
you
know.
Come
on!’
So
they
went
up
to
the
Mock
Turtle,
who
looked
at
them
with
large
eyes
full
of
tears,
but
said
nothing.
‘This
re
young
lady,’
d
the
Gryphon,
‘she
nts
for
to
know
your
history,
she
do.’
‘I’ll
it
her,’
d
the
Mock
Turtle
in
a
deep,
hollow
tone:
‘sit
own,
both
of
you,
and
don’t
eak
a
word
till
I’ve
nished.’
So
they
sat
down,
and
nobody
spoke
for
some
minutes.
Alice
thought
to
herself,
‘I
n’t
e
how
he
can
EVEN
finish,
if
he
doesn’t
gin.’
she
waited
patiently.
‘Once,’
he
Mock
Turtle
at
last,
with
a
deep
sigh,
‘I
s
a
real
Turtle.’
These
words
were
followed
by
a
very
long
silence,
broken
only
by
an
occasional
exclamation
of
‘Hjckrrh!’
he
Gryphon,
and
the
constant
heavy
sobbing
of
the
Mock
Turtle.
Alice
was
very
nearly
getting
up
and
saying,
‘Thank
u,
sir,
for
your
interesting
story,’
she
could
not
help
thinking
there
MUST
be
more
to
come,
so
she
sat
still
and
said
nothing.
‘When
were
little,’
Mock
Turtle
went
on
at
last,
more
calmly,
though
still
sobbing
a
little
now
and
then,
‘we
nt
to
school
in
the
sea.
The
master
was
an
old
Turtle--we
sed
to
call
him
Tortoise--’
Why
id
you
call
him
Tortoise,
if
he
wasn’t
e?’
ce
asked.
‘We
lled
him
Tortoise
because
he
taught
us,’
d
the
Mock
Turtle
angrily:
‘really
u
are
very
dull!’
‘You
ght
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
for
asking
such
a
simple
question,’
ded
the
Gryphon;
and
then
they
both
sat
silent
and
looked
at
poor
Alice,
who
felt
ready
to
sink
into
the
earth.
At
last
the
Gryphon
said
to
the
Mock
Turtle,
‘Drive
,
old
fellow!
Don’t
all
day
about
it!’
d
he
went
on
in
these
words:
‘Yes,
went
to
school
in
the
sea,
though
you
mayn’t
lieve
it--’
I
ever
said
I
didn’t!’
upted
Alice.
‘You
d,’
d
the
Mock
Turtle.
‘Hold
ur
tongue!’
ed
the
Gryphon,
before
Alice
could
speak
again.
The
Mock
Turtle
went
on.
‘We
d
the
best
of
educations--in
act,
we
went
to
school
every
day--’
I’VE
to
a
day-school,
oo,’
d
Alice;
‘you
edn’t
so
proud
as
all
that.’
‘With
tras?’
ed
the
Mock
Turtle
a
little
anxiously.
‘Yes,’
lice,
‘we
arned
French
and
music.’
‘And
shing?’
d
the
Mock
Turtle.
‘Certainly
t!’
d
Alice
indignantly.
‘Ah!
n
yours
wasn’t
really
good
school,’
d
the
Mock
Turtle
in
a
tone
of
great
relief.
‘Now
OURS
they
had
at
the
end
of
the
bill,
“French,
ic,
AND
WASHING--extra.”’
u
couldn’t
ve
wanted
it
much,’
d
Alice;
‘living
the
bottom
of
the
sea.’
‘I
uldn’t
ford
to
learn
it.’
d
the
Mock
Turtle
with
a
sigh.
‘I
nly
took
the
regular
course.’
‘What
s
that?’
uired
Alice.
‘Reeling
d
Writhing,
of
course,
to
begin
with,’
Mock
Turtle
replied;
‘and
en
the
different
branches
of
Arithmetic--Ambition,
istraction,
Uglification,
and
Derision.’
‘I
ver
heard
of
“Uglification,”’
tured
to
say.
‘What
it?’
The
Gryphon
lifted
up
both
its
paws
in
surprise.
‘What!
er
heard

‘You

what
to
beautify
is,
I
suppose?’
‘Yes,’
lice
doubtfully:
‘it
ans--to--make--anything--prettier.’
then,’
Gryphon
went
on,
‘if
u
don’t
ow
what
to
uglify
is,
you
ARE
a
simpleton.’
Alice
did
not
feel
encouraged
to
ask
any
more
questions
about
it,
so
she
turned
to
the
Mock
Turtle,
and
said
‘What
se
had
you
to
learn?’
‘Well,
re
was
Mystery,’
Mock
Turtle
replied,
counting
off
the
subjects
on
his
flappers,
‘--Mystery,
nt
and
modern,
with
Seaography:
then
Drawling--the
rawling-master
was
an
old
conger-eel,
that
used
to
come
once
a
week:
HE
taught
us
Drawling,
Stretching,
and
Fainting
in
Coils.’
‘What
s
THAT
like?’
d
Alice.
‘Well,
an’t
ow
it
you
myself,’
Mock
Turtle
said:
‘I’m
stiff.
And
the
Gryphon
never
learnt
it.’
‘Hadn’t

the
Gryphon:
‘I

the
Classics
master,
though.
He
was
an
old
crab,
HE
was.’
‘I

to
him,’
Mock
Turtle
said
with
a
sigh:
‘he

Laughing
and
Grief,
they
used
to
say.’
‘So
did,
so
he
did,’
d
the
Gryphon,
sighing
in
his
turn;
and
both
creatures
hid
their
faces
in
their
paws.
‘And
w
many
hours
a
day
did
you
do
lessons?’
d
Alice,
in
a
hurry
to
change
the
subject.
‘Ten
urs
the
first
day,’
d
the
Mock
Turtle:
‘nine
e
next,
and
so
on.’
‘What
curious
plan!’
laimed
Alice.
‘That’s
eason
they’re
lled
lessons,’
Gryphon
remarked:
‘because
ey
lessen
from
day
to
day.’
This
was
quite
a
new
idea
to
Alice,
and
she
thought
it
over
a
little
before
she
made
her
next
remark.
‘Then
e
eleventh
day
must
have
been
a
holiday?’
‘Of
urse
it
was,’
d
the
Mock
Turtle.
‘And
w
did
you
manage
on
the
twelfth?’
ce
went
on
eagerly.
‘That’s
h
about
lessons,’
Gryphon
interrupted
in
a
very
decided
tone:
‘tell
r
something
about
the
games
now.’
CHAPTER
X.
The
Lobster
Quadrille
The
Mock
Turtle
sighed
deeply,
and
drew
the
back
of
one
flapper
across
his
eyes.
He
looked
at
Alice,
and
tried
to
speak,
but
for
a
minute
or
two
sobs
choked
his
voice.
‘Same
if
he
had
a
bone
in
his
throat,’
id
the
Gryphon:
and
it
set
to
work
shaking
him
and
punching
him
in
the
back.
At
last
the
Mock
Turtle
recovered
his
voice,
and,
with
tears
running
down
his
cheeks,
he
went
on
again:--
‘You
y
not
have
lived
much
under
the
sea--’
I
haven’t,’
Alice)--‘and
ps
you
were
never
even
introduced
to
a
lobster--’
ice
began
to
say
‘I
ce
tasted--’
checked
herself
hastily,
and
said
‘No,
er’)
--so
ou
can
have
no
idea
what
a
delightful
thing
a
Lobster
Quadrille
is!’
‘No,
eed,’
d
Alice.
‘What
rt
of
a
dance
is
it?’
‘Why,’
he
Gryphon,
‘you
rst
form
into
a
line
along
the
sea-shore--’
Two
lines!’
ed
the
Mock
Turtle.
‘Seals,
tles,
salmon,
and
so
on;
then,
when
you’ve
eared
all
the
jelly-fish
out
of
the
way--’
THAT
enerally
takes
some
time,’
errupted
the
Gryphon.
‘--you
nce
twice--’
Each
ith
a
lobster
as
a
partner!’
ed
the
Gryphon.
‘Of
urse,’
Mock
Turtle
said:
‘advance
ice,
set
to
partners--’
--change
sters,
and
retire
in
same
order,’
tinued
the
Gryphon.
‘Then,
know,’
Mock
Turtle
went
on,
‘you
row
the--’
The
obsters!’
uted
the
Gryphon,
with
a
bound
into
the
air.
‘--as
out
to
sea
as
you
can--’
Swim
fter
them!’
eamed
the
Gryphon.
‘Turn
somersault
in
the
sea!’
ed
the
Mock
Turtle,
capering
wildly
about.
‘Change
bsters
again!’
led
the
Gryphon
at
the
top
of
its
voice.
‘Back
land
again,
and
that’s
l
the
first
figure,’
d
the
Mock
Turtle,
suddenly
dropping
his
voice;
and
the
two
creatures,
who
had
been
jumping
about
like
mad
things
all
this
time,
sat
down
again
very
sadly
and
quietly,
and
looked
at
Alice.
‘It
st
be
a
very
pretty
dance,’
d
Alice
timidly.
‘Would
u
like
to
see
a
little
of
it?’
d
the
Mock
Turtle.
‘Very
ch
indeed,’
d
Alice.
‘Come,
’s
y
the
first
figure!’
d
the
Mock
Turtle
to
the
Gryphon.
‘We
n
do
without
lobsters,
you
know.
Which
shall
sing?’
‘Oh,
sing,’
d
the
Gryphon.
‘I’ve
tten
the
words.’
So
they
began
solemnly
dancing
round
and
round
Alice,
every
now
and
then
treading
on
her
toes
when
they
passed
too
close,
and
waving
their
forepaws
to
mark
the
time,
while
the
Mock
Turtle
sang
this,
very
slowly
and
sadly:--
‘“Will
alk
a
little
faster?”
d
a
whiting
to
a
snail.
“There’s
poise
close
behind
us,
and
he’s
eading
on
my
tail.
See
how
eagerly
the
lobsters
and
the
turtles
all
advance!
They
are
waiting
on
the
shingle--will
ou
come
and
join
the
dance?
Will
you,
won’t
u,
will
you,
won’t

will
you
join

Will
you,
won’t
u,
will
you,
won’t

won’t

dance?
“You
n
really
have
no
notion
how
delightful
it
will
be
When
they
take
us
up
and
throw
us,
with
the
lobsters,
out
to
sea!”
But
the
snail
replied
“Too
r,
too
far!”
gave
a
look
askance--
Said
he
thanked
the
whiting
kindly,
but
he
would
not
join
the
dance.
Would
not,
could
not,
would
not,
could
not,
would
not
join
the
dance.
Would
not,
could
not,
would
not,
could
not,
could
not
join
the
dance.
‘“What
rs
it
how
far
we
go?”
scaly
friend
replied.
“There
another
shore,
you
know,
upon
the
other
side.
The
further
off
from
England
the
nearer
is
to
France--
Then
turn
not
pale,
beloved
snail,
but
come
and
join
the
dance.
Will

Will

won’t
u
join
the
dance?”’
Thank
you,
it’s
very
interesting
dance
to
watch,’
d
Alice,
feeling
very
glad
that
it
was
over
at
last:
‘and
do
so
like
that
curious
song
about
the
whiting!’
‘Oh,
to
the
whiting,’
d
the
Mock
Turtle,
‘they--you’ve
em,
of
course?’
‘Yes,’
lice,
‘I’ve
seen
them
at
dinn--’
checked
herself
hastily.
‘I
n’t
ow
where
Dinn
may
be,’
d
the
Mock
Turtle,
‘but
you’ve
een
them
so
often,
of
course
you
know
what
they’re
ke.’
‘I
lieve
so,’
ce
replied
thoughtfully.
‘They
ve
their
tails
in
their
mouths--and
hey’re
l
over
crumbs.’
‘You’re
about
the
crumbs,’
d
the
Mock
Turtle:
‘crumbs
uld
all
wash
off
in
the
sea.
But
they
HAVE
their
tails
in
their
mouths;
and
the
reason
is--’
the
Mock
Turtle
yawned
and
shut
his
eyes.--‘Tell
about
the
reason
and
all
that,’
said
to
the
Gryphon.
‘The
ason
is,’
d
the
Gryphon,
‘that
ey
WOULD
go
with
the
lobsters
to
the
dance.
So
they
got
thrown
out
to
sea.
So
they
had
to
fall
a
long
way.
So
they
got
their
tails
fast
in
their
mouths.
So
they
couldn’t
t
them
out
again.
That’s
l.’
‘Thank
u,’
d
Alice,
‘it’s
interesting.
I
never
knew
so
much
about
a
whiting
before.’
‘I
n
tell
you
more
than
that,
if
you
like,’
d
the
Gryphon.
‘Do
u
know
why
it’s
lled
a
whiting?’
‘I
ver
thought
about
it,’
d
Alice.
‘Why?’
IT
DOES
THE
BOOTS
AND
SHOES.’
Gryphon
replied
very
solemnly.
Alice
was
thoroughly
puzzled.
‘Does
e
boots
and
shoes!’
repeated
in
a
wondering
tone.
‘Why,
t
are
YOUR
shoes
done
with?’
d
the
Gryphon.
‘I
an,
what
makes
them
so
shiny?’
Alice
looked
down
at
them,
and
considered
a
little
before
she
gave
her
answer.
‘They’re
with
blacking,
I
believe.’
‘Boots
d
shoes
under
the
sea,’
Gryphon
went
on
in
a
deep
voice,
‘are
ne
with
a
whiting.
Now
you
know.’
‘And
at
are
they
made
of?’
ce
asked
in
a
tone
of
great
curiosity.
‘Soles
d
eels,
of
course,’
Gryphon
replied
rather
impatiently:
‘any
rimp
could
have
told
you
that.’
‘If
d
een
the
whiting,’
d
Alice,
whose
thoughts
were
still
running
on
the
song,
‘I’d
said
to
the
porpoise,
“Keep
ck,
please:
we
don’t
nt
YOU
with
us!”’
They
were
obliged
to
have
him
with
them,’
Mock
Turtle
said:
‘no
ise
fish
would
go
anywhere
without
a
porpoise.’
‘Wouldn’t
ally?’
d
Alice
in
a
tone
of
great
surprise.
‘Of
urse
not,’
d
the
Mock
Turtle:
‘why,
a
fish
came
to
ME,
and
told
me
he
was
going
a
journey,
I
should
say
“With
at
porpoise?”’
Don’t
u
mean
“purpose”?’
e.
‘I
an
what
I
say,’
Mock
Turtle
replied
in
an
offended
tone.
And
the
Gryphon
added
‘Come,
’s
ar
some
of
YOUR
adventures.’
‘I
uld
tell
you
my
adventures--beginning
rom
this
morning,’
d
Alice
a
little
timidly:
‘but
’s
use
going
back
to
yesterday,
because
I
was
a
different
person
then.’
‘Explain
l
that,’
d
the
Mock
Turtle.
‘No,
The
adventures
first,’
d
the
Gryphon
in
an
impatient
tone:
‘explanations
ke
such
a
dreadful
time.’
So
Alice
began
telling
them
her
adventures
from
the
time
when
she
first
saw
the
White
Rabbit.
She
was
a
little
nervous
about
it
just
at
first,
the
two
creatures
got
so
close
to
her,
one
on
each
side,
and
opened
their
eyes
and
mouths
so
VERY
wide,
but
she
gained
courage
as
she
went
on.
Her
listeners
were
perfectly
quiet
till
she
got
to
the
part
about
her
repeating
‘YOU
E
OLD,
FATHER
WILLIAM,’
the
Caterpillar,
and
the
words
all
coming
different,
and
then
the
Mock
Turtle
drew
a
long
breath,
and
said
‘That’s
curious.’
‘It’s
bout
as
curious
as
it
can
be,’
d
the
Gryphon.
‘It
l
came
different!’
Mock
Turtle
repeated
thoughtfully.
‘I
hould
like
to
hear
her
try
and
repeat
something
now.
Tell
her
to
begin.’
looked
at
the
Gryphon
as
if
he
thought
it
had
some
kind
of
authority
over
Alice.
‘Stand
and
repeat
“‘TIS
OICE
OF
THE
SLUGGARD,”’
he
Gryphon.
‘How
e
creatures
order

about,
and
make

ought
Alice;
‘I
ght
as
well
be
at
school
at
once.’
ever,
she
got
up,
and
began
to
repeat
it,
but
her
head
was
so
full
of
the
Lobster
Quadrille,
that
she
hardly
knew
what
she
was
saying,
and
the
words
came
very
queer
indeed:--
‘’Tis
oice
of
the
Lobster;
I
heard
him
declare,
“You
ve
baked
me
too
brown,
I
must
sugar
my
hair.”
As
a
duck
with
its
eyelids,
so
he
with
his
nose
Trims
his
belt
and
his
buttons,
and
turns
out
his
toes.’
[later
editions
continued
as
follows
When
the
sands
are
all
dry,
he
is
gay
as
a
lark,
And
will
talk
in
contemptuous
tones
of
the
Shark,
But,
when
the
tide
rises
and
sharks
are
around,
His
voice
has
a
timid
and
tremulous
sound.]
‘That’s
rent
from
what
I
used
to
say
when
I
was
a
child,’
d
the
Gryphon.
‘Well,
ever
heard
it
before,’
d
the
Mock
Turtle;
‘but
sounds
uncommon
nonsense.’
Alice
said
nothing;
she
had
sat
down
with
her
face
in
her
hands,
wondering
if
anything
would
EVER
happen
in
a
natural
way
again.
‘I
ould
like
to
have
it
explained,’
d
the
Mock
Turtle.
‘She
n’t
plain
it,’
d
the
Gryphon
hastily.
‘Go
with
the
next
verse.’
‘But
out

toes?’
Mock
Turtle
persisted.
‘How
ULD

them
out
with
his
nose,
you
know?’
‘It’s
irst
position
in
dancing.’
ce
said;
but
was
dreadfully
puzzled
by
the
whole
thing,
and
longed
to
change
the
subject.
‘Go
with
the
next
verse,’
Gryphon
repeated
impatiently:
‘it
egins
“I
ssed
by
his
garden.”’
ce
did
not
dare
to
disobey,
though
she
felt
sure
it
would
all
come
wrong,
and
she
went
on
in
a
trembling
voice:--
‘I
ssed
by
his
garden,
and
marked,
with
one
eye,
How
the
Owl
and
the
Panther
were
sharing
a
pie--’
[later
editions
continued
as
follows
The
Panther
took
pie-crust,
nd
gravy,
and
meat,
While
the
Owl
had
the
dish
as
its
share
of
the
treat.
When
the
pie
was
all
finished,
the
Owl,
as
a
boon,
Was
kindly
permitted
to
pocket
the
spoon:
While
the
Panther
received
knife
and
fork
with
a
growl,
And
concluded
the
banquet--]
‘What
the
use
of
repeating
all
that
stuff,’
Mock
Turtle
interrupted,
‘if
u
don’t
plain
it
as
you
go
on?
It’s
far
the
most
confusing
thing
I
ever
heard!’
‘Yes,
hink
you’d
tter
leave
off,’
d
the
Gryphon:
and
Alice
was
only
too
glad
to
do
so.
‘Shall
try
another
figure
of
the
Lobster
Quadrille?’
Gryphon
went
on.
‘Or
uld
you
like
the
Mock
Turtle
to
sing
you
a
song?’
‘Oh,
ong,
please,
if
the
Mock
Turtle
would
be
so
kind,’
ce
replied,
so
eagerly
that
the
Gryphon
said,
in
a
rather
offended
tone,
‘Hm!
accounting
for
tastes!
Sing
her
“Turtle
up,”
l
you,
old
fellow?’
The
Mock
Turtle
sighed
deeply,
and
began,
in
a
voice
sometimes
choked
with
sobs,
to
sing
this:--
‘Beautiful
up,
so
rich
and
green,
Waiting
in
a
hot
tureen!
Who
for
such
dainties
would
not
stoop?

‘Chorus

ed
the
Gryphon,
and
the
Mock
Turtle
had
just
begun
to
repeat
it,
when
a
cry
of
‘The
ial’s
ginning!’
heard
in
the
distance.
‘Come
!’
ed
the
Gryphon,
and,
taking
Alice
by
the
hand,
it
hurried
off,
without
waiting
for
the
end
of
the
song.
‘What
ial
is
it?’

panted
as
she
ran;
but
the
Gryphon
only
answered
‘Come

ran
the
faster,
while
more
and
more
faintly
came,
carried
on
the
breeze
that
followed
them,
the
melancholy
words:--
‘Soo--oop

CHAPTER
XI.
Who
Stole
the
Tarts?
The
King
and
Queen
of
Hearts
were
seated
on
their
throne
when
they
arrived,
with
a
great
crowd
assembled
about
them--all
orts
of
little
birds
and
beasts,
as
well
as
the
whole
pack
of
cards:
the
Knave
was
standing
before
them,
in
chains,
with
a
soldier
on
each
side
to
guard
him;
and
near
the
King
was
the
White
Rabbit,
with
a
trumpet
in
one
hand,
and
a
scroll
of
parchment
in
the
other.
In
the
very
middle
of
the
court
was
a
table,
with
a
large
dish
of
tarts
upon
it:
they
looked
so
good,
that
it
made
Alice
quite
hungry
to
look
at
them--‘I
they’d
t
the
trial
done,’
thought,
‘and
nd
round
the
refreshments!’
there
seemed
to
be
no
chance
of
this,
so
she
began
looking
at
everything
about
her,
to
pass
away
the
time.
Alice
had
never
been
in
a
court
of
justice
before,
but
she
had
read
about
them
in
books,
and
she
was
quite
pleased
to
find
that
she
knew
the
name
of
nearly
everything
there.
‘That’s
udge,’
said
to
herself,
‘because
his
great
wig.’
The
judge,
by
the
way,
was
the
King;
and
as
he
wore
his
crown
over
the
wig,
(look
at
the
frontispiece
if
you
want
to
see
how
he
did
it,)
e
did
not
look
at
all
comfortable,
and
it
was
certainly
not
becoming.
‘And
at’s
e
jury-box,’
ght
Alice,
‘and
ose
twelve
creatures,’
he
was
obliged
to
say
‘creatures,’
e,
because
some
of
them
were
animals,
and
some
were
birds,)
I
uppose
they
are
the
jurors.’
said
this
last
word
two
or
three
times
over
to
herself,
being
rather
proud
of
it:
for
she
thought,
and
rightly
too,
that
very
few
little
girls
of
her
age
knew
the
meaning
of
it
at
all.
However,
‘jury-men’
have
done
just
as
well.
The
twelve
jurors
were
all
writing
very
busily
on
slates.
‘What
e
they
doing?’
ce
whispered
to
the
Gryphon.
‘They
n’t
ve
anything
to
put
down
yet,
before
the
trial’s
gun.’
‘They’re
ng
down
their
names,’
Gryphon
whispered
in
reply,
‘for
ear
they
should
forget
them
before
the
end
of
the
trial.’
‘Stupid
ings!’
ce
began
in
a
loud,
indignant
voice,
but
she
stopped
hastily,
for
the
White
Rabbit
cried
out,
‘Silence
the
court!’
the
King
put
on
his
spectacles
and
looked
anxiously
round,
to
make
out
who
was
talking.
Alice
could
see,
as
well
as
if
she
were
looking
over
their
shoulders,
that
all
the
jurors
were
writing
down
‘stupid
ings!’
their
slates,
and
she
could
even
make
out
that
one
of
them
didn’t
ow
how
to
spell
‘stupid,’
at
he
had
to
ask
his
neighbour
to
tell
him.
‘A
ce
muddle
their
slates’ll
in
before
the
trial’s
er!’
ught
Alice.
One
of
the
jurors
had
a
pencil
that
squeaked.
This
of
course,
Alice
could
not
stand,
and
she
went
round
the
court
and
got
behind
him,
and
very
soon
found
an
opportunity
of
taking
it
away.
She
did
it
so
quickly
that
the
poor
little
juror
(it
was
Bill,
the
Lizard)
could
not
make
out
at
all
what
had
become
of
it;
so,
after
hunting
all
about
for
it,
he
was
obliged
to
write
with
one
finger
for
the
rest
of
the
day;
and
this
was
of
very
little
use,
as
it
left
no
mark
on
the
slate.
‘Herald,
d
the
accusation!’
d
the
King.
On
this
the
White
Rabbit
blew
three
blasts
on
the
trumpet,
and
then
unrolled
the
parchment
scroll,
and
read
as
follows:--
‘The
een
of
Hearts,
she
made
some
tarts,
All
on
a
summer
day:
The
Knave
of
Hearts,
he
stole
those
tarts,
And
took
them
quite
away!’
‘Consider
ur
verdict,’
King
said
to
the
jury.
‘Not
t,
not
yet!’
Rabbit
hastily
interrupted.
‘There’s
at
deal
to
come
before
that!’
‘Call
e
first
witness,’
d
the
King;
and
the
White
Rabbit
blew
three
blasts
on
the
trumpet,
and
called
out,
‘First
tness!’
The
first
witness
was
the
Hatter.
He
came
in
with
a
teacup
in
one
hand
and
a
piece
of
bread-and-butter
n
the
other.
‘I
g
pardon,
your
Majesty,’
began,
‘for
inging
these
in:
but
I
hadn’t
ite
finished
my
tea
when
I
was
sent
for.’
‘You
ght
to
have
finished,’
d
the
King.
‘When
d
you
begin?’
The
Hatter
looked
at
the
March
Hare,
who
had
followed
him
into
the
court,
arm-in-arm
ith
the
Dormouse.
‘Fourteenth
March,
I
think
it
was,’
said.
‘Fifteenth,’
he
March
Hare.
‘Sixteenth,’
the
Dormouse.
‘Write
at
down,’
King
said
to
the
jury,
and
the
jury
eagerly
wrote
down
all
three
dates
on
their
slates,
and
then
added
them
up,
and
reduced
the
answer
to
shillings
and
pence.
‘Take
f
your
hat,’
King
said
to
the
Hatter.
‘It
n’t
ne,’
d
the
Hatter.
‘Stolen!’
ng
exclaimed,
turning
to
the
jury,
who
instantly
made
a
memorandum
of
the
fact.
‘I
ep
them
to
sell,’
Hatter
added
as
an
explanation;
‘I’ve
of
my
own.
I’m
hatter.’
Here
the
Queen
put
on
her
spectacles,
and
began
staring
at
the
Hatter,
who
turned
pale
and
fidgeted.
‘Give
ur
evidence,’
d
the
King;
‘and
n’t
nervous,
or
I’ll
ve
you
executed
on
the
spot.’
This
did
not
seem
to
encourage
the
witness
at
all:
he
kept
shifting
from
one
foot
to
the
other,
looking
uneasily
at
the
Queen,
and
in
his
confusion
he
bit
a
large
piece
out
of
his
teacup
instead
of
the
bread-and-butter.
Just
at
this
moment
Alice
felt
a
very
curious
sensation,
which
puzzled
her
a
good
deal
until
she
made
out
what
it
was:
she
was
beginning
to
grow
larger
again,
and
she
thought
at
first
she
would
get
up
and
leave
the
court;
but
on
second
thoughts
she
decided
to
remain
where
she
was
as
long
as
there
was
room
for
her.
‘I
sh
you
wouldn’t
ueeze
so.’
d
the
Dormouse,
who
was
sitting
next
to
her.
‘I
n
hardly
breathe.’
‘I
n’t
lp
it,’
d
Alice
very
meekly:
‘I’m
ng.’
‘You’ve
ght
to
grow
here,’
d
the
Dormouse.
‘Don’t
nonsense,’
d
Alice
more
boldly:
‘you
ow
you’re
owing
too.’
‘Yes,
I
grow
at
a
reasonable
pace,’
d
the
Dormouse:
‘not
that
ridiculous
fashion.’
he
got
up
very
sulkily
and
crossed
over
to
the
other
side
of
the
court.
All
this
time
the
Queen
had
never
left
off
staring
at
the
Hatter,
and,
just
as
the
Dormouse
crossed
the
court,
she
said
to
one
of
the
officers
of
the
court,
‘Bring
the
list
of
the
singers
in
the
last
concert!’
which
the
wretched
Hatter
trembled
so,
that
he
shook
both
his
shoes
off.
‘Give
ur
evidence,’
King
repeated
angrily,
‘or
ll
ave
you
executed,
whether
you’re
rvous
or
not.’
‘I’m
r
man,
your
Majesty,’
Hatter
began,
in
a
trembling
voice,
‘--and
dn’t
gun
my
tea--not
bove
a
week
or
so--and
hat
with
the
bread-and-butter
etting
so
thin--and
he
twinkling
of
the
tea--’
The
winkling
of
the
what?’
d
the
King.
‘It
gan
with
the
tea,’
Hatter
replied.
‘Of
urse
twinkling
begins
with
a
T!’
d
the
King
sharply.
‘Do
u
take
me
for
a
dunce?
Go
on!’
‘I’m
r
man,’
Hatter
went
on,
‘and
st
things
twinkled
after
that--only
he
March
Hare
said--’
I
idn’t!’
rch
Hare
interrupted
in
a
great
hurry.
‘You
d!’
d
the
Hatter.
‘I
ny
it!’
d
the
March
Hare.
‘He
nies
it,’
d
the
King:
‘leave
t
that
part.’
‘Well,
any
rate,
the
Dormouse
said--’
Hatter
went
on,
looking
anxiously
round
to
see
if
he
would
deny
it
too:
but
the
Dormouse
denied
nothing,
being
fast
asleep.
‘After
at,’
tinued
the
Hatter,
‘I
t
some
more
bread-and-butter--’
But
what
did
the
Dormouse
say?’
of
the
jury
asked.
‘That
can’t
member,’
d
the
Hatter.
‘You
ST
remember,’
arked
the
King,
‘or
ll
ave
you
executed.’
The
miserable
Hatter
dropped
his
teacup
and
bread-and-butter,
d
went
down
on
one
knee.
‘I’m
r
man,
your
Majesty,’
began.
‘You’re
y
poor
speaker,’
d
the
King.
Here
one
of
the
guinea-pigs
cheered,
and
was
immediately
suppressed
by
the
officers
of
the
court.
(As
that
is
rather
a
hard
word,
I
will
just
explain
to
you
how
it
was
done.
They
had
a
large
canvas
bag,
which
tied
up
at
the
mouth
with
strings:
into
this
they
slipped
the
guinea-pig,
head
first,
and
then
sat
upon
it.)
‘I’m
I’ve
en
that
done,’
ught
Alice.
‘I’ve
ten
read
in
the
newspapers,
at
the
end
of
trials,
“There
s
some
attempts
at
applause,
which
was
immediately
suppressed
by
the
officers
of
the
court,”
I
never
understood
what
it
meant
till
now.’
‘If
at’s
l
you
know
about
it,
you
may
stand
down,’
tinued
the
King.
‘I
n’t
no
lower,’
d
the
Hatter:
‘I’m
e
floor,
as
it
is.’
‘Then
u
may
SIT
down,’
King
replied.
Here
the
other
guinea-pig
cheered,
and
was
suppressed.
‘Come,
t
finished
the
guinea-pigs!’
ght
Alice.
‘Now
shall
get
on
better.’
‘I’d
r
finish
my
tea,’
d
the
Hatter,
with
an
anxious
look
at
the
Queen,
who
was
reading
the
list
of
singers.
‘You
y
go,’
d
the
King,
and
the
Hatter
hurriedly
left
the
court,
without
even
waiting
to
put
his
shoes
on.
‘--and
take
his
head
off
outside,’
Queen
added
to
one
of
the
officers:
but
the
Hatter
was
out
of
sight
before
the
officer
could
get
to
the
door.
‘Call
e
next
witness!’
d
the
King.
The
next
witness
was
the
Duchess’s
ok.
She
carried
the
pepper-box
in
her
hand,
and
Alice
guessed
who
it
was,
even
before
she
got
into
the
court,
by
the
way
the
people
near
the
door
began
sneezing
all
at
once.
‘Give
ur
evidence,’
d
the
King.
‘Shan’t,’
cook.
The
King
looked
anxiously
at
the
White
Rabbit,
who
said
in
a
low
voice,
‘Your
jesty
must
cross-examine
THIS
witness.’
‘Well,
I
must,
I
must,’
King
said,
with
a
melancholy
air,
and,
after
folding
his
arms
and
frowning
at
the
cook
till
his
eyes
were
nearly
out
of
sight,
he
said
in
a
deep
voice,
‘What
e
tarts
made
of?’
‘Pepper,
tly,’
d
the
cook.
‘Treacle,’
sleepy
voice
behind
her.
‘Collar
at
Dormouse,’
Queen
shrieked
out.
‘Behead
at
Dormouse!
Turn
that
Dormouse
out
of
court!
Suppress
him!
Pinch
him!
Off
with
his
whiskers!’
For
some
minutes
the
whole
court
was
in
confusion,
getting
the
Dormouse
turned
out,
and,
by
the
time
they
had
settled
down
again,
the
cook
had
disappeared.
‘Never
nd!’
d
the
King,
with
an
air
of
great
relief.
‘Call
e
next
witness.’
he
added
in
an
undertone
to
the
Queen,
‘Really,
dear,
YOU
must
cross-examine
the
next
witness.
It
quite
makes
my
forehead
ache!’
Alice
watched
the
White
Rabbit
as
he
fumbled
over
the
list,
feeling
very
curious
to
see
what
the
next
witness
would
be
like,
‘--for
haven’t
ot
much
evidence
YET,’
said
to
herself.
Imagine
her
surprise,
when
the
White
Rabbit
read
out,
at
the
top
of
his
shrill
little
voice,
the
name
‘Alice!’
CHAPTER
XII.
Alice’s
idence
‘Here!’
Alice,
quite
forgetting
in
the
flurry
of
the
moment
how
large
she
had
grown
in
the
last
few
minutes,
and
she
jumped
up
in
such
a
hurry
that
she
tipped
over
the
jury-box
with
the
edge
of
her
skirt,
upsetting
all
the
jurymen
on
to
the
heads
of
the
crowd
below,
and
there
they
lay
sprawling
about,
reminding
her
very
much
of
a
globe
of
goldfish
she
had
accidentally
upset
the
week
before.
‘Oh,
EG
your
pardon!’
exclaimed
in
a
tone
of
great
dismay,
and
began
picking
them
up
again
as
quickly
as
she
could,
for
the
accident
of
the
goldfish
kept
running
in
her
head,
and
she
had
a
vague
sort
of
idea
that
they
must
be
collected
at
once
and
put
back
into
the
jury-box,
r
they
would
die.
‘The
ial
cannot
proceed,’
d
the
King
in
a
very
grave
voice,
‘until
ll
the
jurymen
are
back
in
their
proper
places--ALL,’
peated
with
great
emphasis,
looking
hard
at
Alice
as
he
said
do.
Alice
looked
at
the
jury-box,
nd
saw
that,
in
her
haste,
she
had
put
the
Lizard
in
head
downwards,
and
the
poor
little
thing
was
waving
its
tail
about
in
a
melancholy
way,
being
quite
unable
to
move.
She
soon
got
it
out
again,
and
put
it
right;
‘not
at
it
signifies
much,’
said
to
herself;
‘I
ould
think
it
would
be
QUITE
as
much
use
in
the
trial
one
way
up
as
the
other.’
As
soon
as
the
jury
had
a
little
recovered
from
the
shock
of
being
upset,
and
their
slates
and
pencils
had
been
found
and
handed
back
to
them,
they
set
to
work
very
diligently
to
write
out
a
history
of
the
accident,
all
except
the
Lizard,
who
seemed
too
much
overcome
to
do
anything
but
sit
with
its
mouth
open,
gazing
up
into
the
roof
of
the
court.
‘What
you
know
about
this
business?’
King
said
to
Alice.
‘Nothing,’
lice.
‘Nothing
ATEVER?’
sisted
the
King.
‘Nothing
atever,’
d
Alice.
‘That’s
important,’
King
said,
turning
to
the
jury.
They
were
just
beginning
to
write
this
down
on
their
slates,
when
the
White
Rabbit
interrupted:
‘UNimportant,
r
Majesty
means,
of
course,’
said
in
a
very
respectful
tone,
but
frowning
and
making
faces
at
him
as
he
spoke.
‘UNimportant,
course,
I
meant,’
King
hastily
said,
and
went
on
to
himself
in
an
undertone,
‘important--unimportant--unimportant--important--’
trying
which
word
sounded
best.
Some
of
the
jury
wrote
it
down
‘important,’
me
‘unimportant.’
could
see
this,
as
she
was
near
enough
to
look
over
their
slates;
‘but
doesn’t
tter
a
bit,’
thought
to
herself.
At
this
moment
the
King,
who
had
been
for
some
time
busily
writing
in
his
note-book,
ackled
out
‘Silence!’
ad
out
from
his
book,
‘Rule
orty-two.
LL
PERSONS
MORE
THAN
A
MILE
HIGH
TO
LEAVE
THE
COURT.’
Everybody
looked
at
Alice.
‘I’M
mile
high,’
d
Alice.
‘You
e,’
d
the
King.
‘Nearly
o
miles
high,’
ed
the
Queen.
‘Well,
han’t
,
at
any
rate,’
d
Alice:
‘besides,
t’s
t
a
regular
rule:
you
invented
it
just
now.’
‘It’s
ldest
rule
in
the
book,’
d
the
King.
‘Then
ought
to
be
Number
One,’
d
Alice.
The
King
turned
pale,
and
shut
his
note-book
hastily.
‘Consider
ur
verdict,’
said
to
the
jury,
in
a
low,
trembling
voice.
‘There’s
evidence
to
come
yet,
please
your
Majesty,’
d
the
White
Rabbit,
jumping
up
in
a
great
hurry;
‘this
per
has
just
been
picked
up.’
‘What’s
?’
d
the
Queen.
‘I
ven’t
ened
it
yet,’
d
the
White
Rabbit,
‘but
seems
to
be
a
letter,
written
by
the
prisoner
to--to
omebody.’
‘It
st
have
been
that,’
d
the
King,
‘unless
was
written
to
nobody,
which
isn’t

know.’
‘Who

directed
to?’
d
one
of
the
jurymen.
‘It

the
White
Rabbit;
‘in

‘It

‘Are

ed

of

‘No,

White

‘He

(The

brightened
up
again.)
‘Please

Knave,

‘If

ve
signed
your
name
like
an
honest
man.’
There
was
a
general
clapping
of
hands
at
this:
it
was
the
first
really
clever
thing
the
King
had
said
that
day.
‘That
OVES
his
guilt,’
d
the
Queen.
‘It
oves
nothing
of
the
sort!’
d
Alice.
‘Why,
don’t
en
know
what
they’re
out!’
‘Read
em,’
d
the
King.
The
White
Rabbit
put
on
his
spectacles.
‘Where
all
I
begin,
please
your
Majesty?’
asked.
‘Begin
the
beginning,’
King
said
gravely,
‘and
on
till
you
come
to
the
end:
then
stop.’
These
were
the
verses
the
White
Rabbit
read:--
‘They
ld
me
you
had
been
to
her,
And
mentioned
me
to
him:
She
gave
me
a
good
character,
But
said
I
could
not
swim.
He
sent
them
word
I
had
not
gone
(We
know
it
to
be
true):
If
she
should
push
the
matter
on,
What
would
become
of
you?
I
gave
her
one,
they
gave
him
two,
You
gave
us
three
or
more;
They
all
returned
from
him
to
you,
Though
they
were
mine
before.
If
I
or
she
should
chance
to
be
Involved
in
this
affair,
He
trusts
to
you
to
set
them
free,
Exactly
as
we
were.
My
notion
was
that
you
had
been
(Before
she
had
this
fit)
An
obstacle
that
came
between
Him,
and
ourselves,
and
it.
Don’t
t
him
know
she
liked
them
best,
For
this
must
ever
be
A
secret,
kept
from
all
the
rest,
Between
yourself
and
me.’
‘That’s
ost
important
piece
of
evidence
we’ve
ard
yet,’
d
the
King,
rubbing
his
hands;
‘so
w
let
the
jury--’
If
ny
one
of
them
can
explain
it,’
d
Alice,
(she
had
grown
so
large
in
the
last
few
minutes
that
she
wasn’t
bit
afraid
of
interrupting
him,)
I’ll
him
sixpence.
_I_
on’t
lieve
there’s
atom
of
meaning
in
it.’
The
jury
all
wrote
down
on
their
slates,
‘SHE
esn’t
lieve
there’s
atom
of
meaning
in
it,’
none
of
them
attempted
to
explain
the
paper.
‘If
ere’s
meaning
in
it,’
d
the
King,
‘that
ves
a
world
of
trouble,
you
know,
as
we
needn’t
y
to
find
any.
And
yet
I
don’t
ow,’
went
on,
spreading
out
the
verses
on
his
knee,
and
looking
at
them
with
one
eye;
‘I
em
to
see
some
meaning
in
them,
after
all.
“--SAID
OULD
NOT
SWIM--”
can’t
im,
can
you?’
added,
turning
to
the
Knave.
The
Knave
shook
his
head
sadly.
‘Do
look
like
it?’
said.
(Which
he
certainly
did
NOT,
being
made
entirely
of
cardboard.)
‘All
ght,
so
far,’
d
the
King,
and
he
went
on
muttering
over
the
verses
to
himself:
‘“WE
IT
TO
BE
TRUE--”
’s
e
jury,
of
course--“I
HER
ONE,
THEY
GAVE
HIM
TWO--”
that
must
be
what
he
did
with
the
tarts,
you
know--’
But,
goes
on
“THEY
L
RETURNED
FROM
HIM
TO
YOU,”’
lice.
‘Why,
re
they
are!’
d
the
King
triumphantly,
pointing
to
the
tarts
on
the
table.
‘Nothing
n
be
clearer
than
THAT.
Then
again--“BEFORE
HAD
THIS
FIT--”
never
had
fits,
my
dear,
I
think?’
said
to
the
Queen.
‘Never!’
he
Queen
furiously,
throwing
an
inkstand
at
the
Lizard
as
she
spoke.
(The
unfortunate
little
Bill
had
left
off
writing
on
his
slate
with
one
finger,
as
he
found
it
made
no
mark;
but
he
now
hastily
began
again,
using
the
ink,
that
was
trickling
down
his
face,
as
long
as
it
lasted.)
‘Then
e
words
don’t
T
you,’
d
the
King,
looking
round
the
court
with
a
smile.
There
was
a
dead
silence.
‘It’s
!’
King
added
in
an
offended
tone,
and
everybody
laughed,
‘Let
e
jury
consider
their
verdict,’
King
said,
for
about
the
twentieth
time
that
day.
‘No,
’
id
the
Queen.
‘Sentence
rst--verdict
fterwards.’
‘Stuff
d
nonsense!’
d
Alice
loudly.
‘The
ea
of
having
the
sentence
first!’
‘Hold
ur
tongue!’
d
the
Queen,
turning
purple.
‘I
n’t!’
lice.
‘Off
th
her
head!’
Queen
shouted
at
the
top
of
her
voice.
Nobody
moved.
‘Who
res
for
you?’
d
Alice,
(she
had
grown
to
her
full
size
by
this
time.)
You’re
ing
but
a
pack
of
cards!’
At
this
the
whole
pack
rose
up
into
the
air,
and
came
flying
down
upon
her:
she
gave
a
little
scream,
half
of
fright
and
half
of
anger,
and
tried
to
beat
them
off,
and
found
herself
lying
on
the
bank,
with
her
head
in
the
lap
of
her
sister,
who
was
gently
brushing
away
some
dead
leaves
that
had
fluttered
down
from
the
trees
upon
her
face.
‘Wake
,
Alice
dear!’
d
her
sister;
‘Why,
t
a
long
sleep
you’ve
ad!’
‘Oh,
ve
had
such
a
curious
dream!’
d
Alice,
and
she
told
her
sister,
as
well
as
she
could
remember
them,
all
these
strange
Adventures
of
hers
that
you
have
just
been
reading
about;
and
when
she
had
finished,
her
sister
kissed
her,
and
said,
‘It
S
a
curious
dream,
dear,
certainly:
but
now
run
in
to
your
tea;
it’s
tting
late.’
Alice
got
up
and
ran
off,
thinking
while
she
ran,
as
well
she
might,
what
a
wonderful
dream
it
had
been.
But
her
sister
sat
still
just
as
she
left
her,
leaning
her
head
on
her
hand,
watching
the
setting
sun,
and
thinking
of
little
Alice
and
all
her
wonderful
Adventures,
till
she
too
began
dreaming
after
a
fashion,
and
this
was
her
dream:--
First,
she
dreamed
of
little
Alice
herself,
and
once
again
the
tiny
hands
were
clasped
upon
her
knee,
and
the
bright
eager
eyes
were
looking
up
into
hers--she
ould
hear
the
very
tones
of
her
voice,
and
see
that
queer
little
toss
of
her
head
to
keep
back
the
wandering
hair
that
WOULD
always
get
into
her
eyes--and
till
as
she
listened,
or
seemed
to
listen,
the
whole
place
around
her
became
alive
with
the
strange
creatures
of
her
little
sister’s
eam.
The
long
grass
rustled
at
her
feet
as
the
White
Rabbit
hurried
by--the
frightened
Mouse
splashed
his
way
through
the
neighbouring
pool--she
could
hear
the
rattle
of
the
teacups
as
the
March
Hare
and
his
friends
shared
their
never-ending
meal,
and
the
shrill
voice
of
the
Queen
ordering
off
her
unfortunate
guests
to
execution--once
ore
the
pig-baby
was
sneezing
on
the
Duchess’s
ee,
while
plates
and
dishes
crashed
around
it--once
ore
the
shriek
of
the
Gryphon,
the
squeaking
of
the
Lizard’s
ate-pencil,
nd
the
choking
of
the
suppressed
guinea-pigs,
filled
the
air,
mixed
up
with
the
distant
sobs
of
the
miserable
Mock
Turtle.
So
she
sat
on,
with
closed
eyes,
and
half
believed
herself
in
Wonderland,
though
she
knew
she
had
but
to
open
them
again,
and
all
would
change
to
dull
reality--the
rass
would
be
only
rustling
in
the
wind,
and
the
pool
rippling
to
the
waving
of
the
reeds--the
attling
teacups
would
change
to
tinkling
sheep-bells,
nd
the
Queen’s
rill
cries
to
the
voice
of
the
shepherd
boy--and
he
sneeze
of
the
baby,
the
shriek
of
the
Gryphon,
and
all
the
other
queer
noises,
would
change
(she
knew)
to
the
confused
clamour
of
the
busy
farm-yard--while
e
lowing
of
the
cattle
in
the
distance
would
take
the
place
of
the
Mock
Turtle’s
eavy
sobs.
Lastly,
she
pictured
to
herself
how
this
same
little
sister
of
hers
would,
in
the
after-time,
e
herself
a
grown
woman;
and
how
she
would
keep,
through
all
her
riper
years,
the
simple
and
loving
heart
of
her
childhood:
and
how
she
would
gather
about
her
other
little
children,
and
make
THEIR
eyes
bright
and
eager
with
many
a
strange
tale,
perhaps
even
with
the
dream
of
Wonderland
of
long
ago:
and
how
she
would
feel
with
all
their
simple
sorrows,
and
find
a
pleasure
in
all
their
simple
joys,
remembering
her
own
child-life,
nd
the
happy
summer
days.
